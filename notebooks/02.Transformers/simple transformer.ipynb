       "[{'guid': 3, 'text_a': 'The news could not have reached Remira Alarsa at a worse moment  Since leaving her home in Venezuela last month the former teacher her husband and nephew had trekked thousands of miles through seven countries determined to resettle in the US  only to be robbed of their savings in Guatemala  Soon afterwards she learned that it might all have been for nothing  On 12 October the Biden administration announced that it would deport Venezuelan migrants to Mexico under a previously obscure public health law Title 42 which was used for summary expulsions by the Trump administration and has been continued under Joe Biden  Venezuelans arriving at the southern border will no longer be able to join their families in the US while they wait their turn in the asylum process but will be forced to languish in Mexico where they are routinely targeted for rape robbery and extortion  The abrupt implementation of Title 42 for Venezuelans has created an arbitrary cutoff and left tens of thousands to an uncertain future  Alarsa is now in Tapachula a migrant hub on the MexicoGuatemala border where refugees are processed by the Mexican government With the length of Mexico still ahead of her and at least two weeks before she reaches the US border and her fate with it she must decide whether to turn back or forge ahead  We have to keep going as there is no other option I keep trying to tell myself that I didnt leave two weeks too late that this was the perfect timing But at every stop money is taken from you little by little And now were going to have to pay a lot more Alarsa said  Critics of Title 42 say it represents a gutting of the right to request asylum for vulnerable people with few other options  Just at the moment that the Biden administration is fighting a lawsuit to try to end Title 42 they are also expanding it which is just baffling Weve lost just about any pretense that this is a health measure They are using a backdoor way to end the right to asylum said Adam Isacson director of the Defense Oversight Program at the Washington Office on Latin America  Nearly 7 million Venezuelans have fled economic collapse and political repression since 2018 most of them settling elsewhere in South America But this year has seen an unprecedented surge of migrants from the country walking north  In most recent years the number of Venezuelans detained at the US southern border has been fewer than 100 but between November 2021 and September 2022 about 150000 Venezuelans have made the dangerous journey over land to the US  If they deport me to Mexico Ill stay and work here Ill work anywhere they let me  economically every option would be better than going back to Venezuela I was making twenty dollars a month in Caracas said Alcides Granado who was lounging in Tapachulas central plaza sheltering from the punishing sun under a floppy cloth hat  But in another shock to those still heading north Venezuelans deported over the past week have received a notice from the Mexican government upon their arrival demanding that they leave the country within 15 days exactly how they came  through the southern border with Guatemala  Venezuelan migrants walk towards Tapachula from Huixtla Chiapas state Mexico on 14 October Photograph AFPGetty Images  Many in Tapachula worry they will be forced back to this city in a few short weeks  None are planning to return to Venezuela the way they came through the jungle of the Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama where travellers must negotiate treacherous jungle terrain flashfloods and predatory gangs  If you gave me a million dollars right now I still would not enter the Darién again said Remiras husband Ramón Iflán  Some of the Venezuelans who will be deported from the US to Mexico  and then possibly forced out of Mexico as well  have nothing to return to in their home country having sold everything they own aside from what they can carry on their backs  Many have not even left any family behind bringing children siblings aunts uncles cousins and even grandparents on the journey with them  In Tapachulas central plaza hundreds of Venezuelans huddle trying to come up with a reasonable plan B One man suggested holding a protest march to get the attention of US authorities but there was little support for his idea  Others were already raising money to pay coyotes who traffic people over the border for up to 10000 a passenger These arrangements can be extremely dangerous in July 50 migrants from Central America and Mexico died in an overheated truck when they were abandoned on the side of the road by smugglers in Texas  The smugglers who have already been doing really well under Title 42 as it has been used on people from the Northern Triangle Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador now have a huge huge new consumer base Isaacson said I dont know of a single border city where shelters are not already overflowing There will be more people on the street more people kidnapped and those who do make it into the US and evade capture will have a very unstable existence', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

       " {'guid': 52, 'text_a': 'Juan Chonillo a 44yearold Ecuadorian immigrant was working on a luxury Manhattan skyscraper in September 2017 when he plummeted 29 stories from a scaffold to his death  The scaffolding platform holding Chonillo got stuck while being moved by a crane After he released his harness to try and unjam the platform the scaffold jolted causing him to fall to another scaffold just above the sidewalk at 161 Maiden Lane In 2018 a year after his death SSC High Rise a subcontractor working on the site under general contractor Pizzarotti pleaded guilty to manslaughter SSC High Rise broke building codes and violated guidelines from the scaffolding manufacturer by moving the platform while workers were still on it according to an investigation led by the Manhattan District Attorneys Office  The company paid a 10000 corporate fine for its role in his death the maximum penalty under New York state law Nobody got locked up Nobody got a real punishment said Elias Riera Chonillos nephew who also works in construction I guess that means you can put somebody at risk just plead guilty and thats it Chonillo who left behind five children was supposed to have that day off said Riera But after being called into work at the last minute he left his home in Queens and headed to the job site of Seaport Residences a 60floor residential building in Manhattans Financial District  Pizzarotti had already received 10 safety citations from New York Citys Department of Buildings DOB on the site since January of 2017 according to city records  Riera said his uncle had been in the citys construction industry for more than six years A few days before Chonillos fatal fall the two of them met up to play volleyball in the park where Chonillo warned his nephew of the jobs safety hazards He said Yo a lot of people are dying in construction you guys Make sure you put on a harness and tie it recalled Riera And then a week later he died  Jobs involving scaffolding those temporary structures blanketing New York City are some of the most dangerous in a notoriously deadly industry And Chonillos story of an immigrant worker whose death could have been prevented were it not for contractor negligence and a glaring lack of accountability is just one of many  So far 2022 has proven one of the deadliest years for construction employees working at heights This year nine workers have died on New York City construction sites and five of these fatalities involved scaffolding or sidewalk sheds with employees falling anywhere from 15 to 65 feet to their deaths according to an Observer analysis of city data While worker falls are consistently the most common cause of injuries and fatalities in New York City construction in previous years fewer fatal falls involved scaffolding  The leading cause of incidents at construction sites in 2020 and 2021 was worker falls and scaffold fence or shoring installations were a thirdleading cause according to a DOB report falling material was second In February 2021 alone eight construction workers were harmed while working with scaffolding according to  analysis of city data with injuries ranging from ribs to lower back to neck  The DOB points to a decrease in constructionrelated injuries and deaths in recent years as evidence its safety and enforcement initiatives are working But while construction injuries and fatalities have fallen over the past four years this trend also occurred in parallel with a decline in building due to the pandemic Constructionrelated deaths fell from 14 to 8 between 2019 and 2020 as did the number of building permits and workers employed at New York City construction sites by 11 percent and 16 percent respectively After 2020 the number of workers who died on construction sites began to increase as building activity and employment picked up again  Barry LePatner a New York Citybased construction attorney said the vast majority of contractors he encounters in his work act responsibly But with such a high volume of construction going on in the city at any given time he conceded a lot of owners hire less than reputable contractors to come onto their projects who are less attuned to the importance of safety  When owners and contractors flout safety it comes down to money said LePatner Its always somebody trying to save money put it into their pocket and beef up their profits  A law that would impose higher penalties on contractors like the one cited in Rieras death is now awaiting the signature of New York Governor Kathy Hochul who must sign it before the end of 2022 in order for the legislation to take effect But Carloss Law named for a construction worker who was killed in 2015 and passed by the state legislature in June continues to face opposition from New Yorks powerful construction and real estate industries Hochul is currently reviewing the legislation according to Justin Henry a spokesman for the governor  Weve got to get the governor to sign it to make it into law now said Francisco Moya a New York City council member representing Corona Queens who introduced Carloss Law in 2017 as a state assemblymember It would really shed light on workers in the shadows of this industry  A common sighting with hidden dangers  Scaffolding is a conspicuous feature of everyday life for New Yorkers as common as cornerstore bodegas or subway delays New York City has more than one million buildings and as of December had more than 13000 active permits for supported scaffolds or sidewalk sheds according to DOB data There are hundreds more active permits for suspended scaffolds the type of scaffolds that are suspended by ropes of a building though the exact figure isnt known  Though much of the scaffolding is used for laborers employed at construction sites sidewalk sheds are erected to protect pedestrians from falling debris when buildings are undergoing construction or are found to have safety violations on their facades Since 1980 after a Barnard student was killed by a falling piece of terra cotta the city has required regular inspections for buildings more than six stories tall Rather than fix the issues right away building owners typically put up sheds to start which helps explain why there are more than 9000 of them currently scattered throughout the city    If you have information about negligent behavior in New York Citys scaffolding industry send an email to the reporters at cvinopalobservercom or atremaynepengellyobservercom  The sheer volume of construction in the city at any given time drives demand for scaffolding    Why are there so many scaffolds in New York City Because theres so much damn building going on in New York City said Jeff Grabelsky a former construction union official who now codirects the National Labor Leadership Institute at Cornell University The number of building permits issued in New York City reached a peak of 168243 in 2017 close to double the number issued in the year 2000    Incidents that occur on scaffolding are reflective of broader issues that have long plagued the New York City construction industry which tends to employ vulnerable laborers who arent unionized and incentivizes contractors to award projects to the lowest bidder Nearly one in four New York City workplace deaths occurred on a construction site in 2021 according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health NYCOSH an organization advocating for immigrant workers rights  Immigrant nonunion workers bear the brunt of injuries  In order for scaffolding to be erected on a construction site a buildings general contractor usually hires a scaffolding subcontractor whose workers build and put up scaffolds for the use of companies working on the site Some of the biggest names in the industry are the Bronxbased Colgate Scaffolding and Brooklyns Silvercup Scaffolding both of which were faced with safety incidents this year A Colgate Scaffolding worker died in November while erecting a sidewalk shed while Silvercup Scaffolding in July was indicted by the Brooklyn District Attorney over a scaffolding collapse which left three injured and a young woman with severe brain damage Colgate and Silvercup did not respond to requests for comment  Accidents most frequently occur on nonunion work sites which lack the standards of safety training and education on safety rights which are prevalent within construction unions In 2018 more than 80 percent of construction fatalities in New York City occurred on nonunion sites according to a NYCOSH report  Despite their disproportionate share of safety incidents nonunionized work sites receive far less monitoring in part because union workers dont fear retaliation for flagging safety issues Its more likely that a union member would file a complaint and bring that violation to the attention of the appropriate agency than a nonunion worker said Grabelsky  Since 2005 any worker erecting a supported scaffold more than 40 feet high must first obtain a permit and undergo a 32hour training course according to Peter Amato a certified site safety manager and former assistant commissioner at the DOB Supported scaffolding refers to platforms connected and supported by pipes and construction workers using the scaffolds must also complete a fourhour training course before working on them Platforms suspended from above by cables or ropes are called suspended scaffolds and workers setting them up must also finish a 32hour course said Amato while their users are required to undergo 16 hours of training  Scaffolding accidents are often the result of companies cutting corners and ignoring procedures designed to protect workers Safety violations among New York Citys scaffolding erectors are rampant said Anthony Corrado a former construction worker who founded NYC Safety Services a safety consulting firm Its like a freeforall he said  Scaffolders hardly ever tie their harnesses to something secure said Corrado Despite Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA requirements that call for most employees working above 10 feet to secure their harnesses scaffolders only need the ability to tie off as they have to be unclipped in certain instances to avoid getting caught up in construction materials Theyve now taken this to the point where they dont feel they have to tie off at all said Corrado  In addition to not being tied securely scaffolders in New York City typically place just two wooden boards on a diagonal in order to walk between platforms while putting up levels of scaffolding No one is monitoring them said Corrado Easily they can fall to their death      Play    The scaffolding industry opposes the extra time and costs that new safety procedures and policies would create Corrado said They could provide more planking they could provide lifelines that string from one end of the scaffold to the other he said Is it going to slow down the process and cost more money Absolutely  Meanwhile accidents involving workers on scaffolding for other constructionrelated tasks occur when the platforms havent been boarded up properly according to Kevin Sullivan OSHA area director for Long Island and Queens Sullivan said he often sees cases where platforms either havent been planked with enough boards or have been planked unevenly Sometimes if you step on a board at the end the whole board can flip up and people can fall that way he said  This happens because contractors simply dont want to waste time by bringing up enough planks up from a lower level said Sullivan I think its just really a lack of diligence he said And while the sides of scaffolding platforms usually have fall barriers employers tend to overlook guarding the ends which are often used as access points added Sullivan  Scaffolding jobs often go to immigrant workers who are unaware of how to advocate for better safety rights or are pressured by contractors to keep quiet about their concerns These people that own the companies they tell workers you cant say anything said Riera And some of us are illegal you know and dont want to lose a job The majority of fatalities OSHA sees in his areas are Spanishspeaking immigrants Sullivan said  A lot of immigrant workers particularly when youre looking at lower wage workers are conducting that kind of work said Charlene Obernauer director of NYCOSH More than half of New York Citys construction workforce 53 percent are immigrants according to a 2021 report from the New York comptrollers office Immigrant and undocumented workers are also more likely to be work on small nonunionized sites said Sullivan  Some contractors with nonunion work forces purposefully fail to educate their employees on safety rights according to Arsecio Ludena a construction worker living in the Bronx Training will explain to someone what to do if you run into issues he said It opens eyes and the contractors dont like that Ludena who moved to New York City 15 ago from Ecuador mostly does jobs like plastering and tiling avoiding work involving scaffolding because its more dangerous  Why bad actors keep working  While the citys DOB and OSHA are tasked with inspecting New York City construction sites for safetyrelated issues the mechanisms they have for holding bad actors accountable can fall short  On Nov 2 Raúl Tenelema Puli 27 fell to his death while building a sidewalk shed at a construction site in downtown Brooklyn with a history of safety violations Puli was installing a 30foot Ibeam for the shed when he fell 20 feet according to DOB records The general contractor overseeing the project Galaxy Developers had previously been cited six times by the DOB for construction safety enforcement issues at the site and paid 11250 in penalties The subcontractor that employed Puli Colgate Scaffolding was fined 8400 and 5000 by OSHA in 2003 and 2008 respectively both times for failing to comply with the agencys general requirements for scaffolds Still the companies remained in business By Nov 29 the DOB lifted a stop work order for the site after Galaxy provided a plan for how they planned to continue work at the site in a safe manner and a subsequent DOB inspection of the site found no unsafe conditions  In an emailed statement Galaxy said they were deeply saddened by the accident and are cooperating with the DOB in an investigation Colgate declined to comment about Pulis death Several parallel investigations are ongoing related to this incident involving the DOB OSHA and law enforcement partners according to the DOB The agency noted all construction fatalities in New York City are investigated for criminality and said enforcement actions are still pending OSHA didnt respond to a request for comment  Researchers and labor advocates who have studied safety issues in the construction industry say theres often a nest of contractors and subcontractors employed under one general contractor and developer on a site making it hard to hold employers accountable when scaffolding accidents occur There may be 15 to 20 subcontractors employed at one site if a project is large such as a highrise development and seven to eight of those subcontractors might be working on the site at the same time estimated Louis Coletti head of the New York Building Trades Employers Association of New York  Whats more the penalties contractors receive pale in comparison to the revenues reaped in a billiondollar industry The fines are very very minimal said Nadia MarinMolina of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network NDLON And the fact that developers continue to hire some of these contractors whether its general contractors or subcontractors shows the disregard that they have for the workers  State officials have raised concerns about safety oversight An audit released by the New York state comptrollers office in September found violations issued by the citys DOB had not been effective in getting owners and contractors to address safety issues on their sites Auditors visited 18 New York City building sites over a period of two months and found 77 safety violations across 16 of those sites In some cases the DOB had previously issued violations that appeared to mirror what auditors found suggesting owners and contractors had not fixed the safety issues despite warnings from the city  Uncovering patterns of noncompliance led the comptrollers office to recommend the DOB use data tracking to identify highrisk contractors and proactively inspect problematic sites They cant inspect every construction site every daythere is a finite number of resources The question really comes to how they use the data they have available to prioritize where the highest risk is said David Schaeffer an audit manager with the comptrollers office  Andrew Rudansky a spokesperson for the DOB said by email the department disagreed with the comptrollers report and noted construction injuries have dropped by close to 33 percent since 2018 thanks in part to our implementation of a firstinthenation safety training requirement for construction workers and our robust enforcement of safety standards on work sites across the five boroughs He said the suggestion the DOB is overstretched when it comes to safety enforcement is not true  A separate Dec 6 report by the New York City comptrollers office revealed the DOB is understaffed with a 227 percent vacancy rate While the city has authorized the department to hire 1978 workers it only employed 1529 workers fulltime as of October 2020 The DOB said it was seeking to cut staff shortages through recruitment efforts  Up until 2015 the DOB required the presence of a site safety manager to oversee the safety of erecting supported and suspended scaffolding on buildings 15 stories or higher But seven years ago the department modified this obligation for facade repair projects which commonly use suspended scaffolds allowing a qualified person to oversee safety at certain times The DOB noted the individual replacing a site safety manager must still possess a Site Safety Training SST Supervisor Card  I think that was a mistake and I told the DOB at that time said Amato who previously worked at the DOB and who also has concerns about the lack of site safety managers for scaffolding erection at building sites under 15 stories Thats a big fear of mine that those lowrise buildings dont have the same requirements he said  Insurance companies which pay out settlements when workers are injured also have an incentive to police unsafe contractors in the industry In theory companies with more injured workers should pay higher premiums But in practice unsafe employers arent penalized by rising rates  Under New York states scaffolding law workers who are injured by a fall can file claims against building owners and general contractors who are considered absolutely liable when a worker falls or is hit by a falling object Block OToole  Murphy which represents plaintiffs in these cases publishes settlements ranging from 1 million to 15 million on its website  Still Tom Stebbins executive director of the Lawsuit Alliance Reform of New York which lobbies for reforms to the scaffolding law argues it doesnt hold bad actors accountable due to a strict liability standard that tends to award workers damages for falls no matter who is at fault  If you have someone whos typically 90 percent responsible for the injuries to their employees versus a company that is 10 percent responsible for the injuries to employees those contractors are both treated the same under the New York scaffolding law Stebbins said Because there is no comparative negligence its very difficult for the market to ascertain who is more safe or less safe  Advocates of the scaffold safety law maintain that its an important safeguard for construction workers in New York I think theres always some folks in the business community that are trying to do away with the Scaffold Safety law but we maintain the position that its an important protection for workers said Obernauer of NYCOSH  Where contractors cut corners  Paul Meli who oversees site safety and risk management for Triton a New York cItybased construction company said labor shortages may contribute to safety issues Earlier this year 91 percent of construction firms said worker shortages were driving up costs according to a September survey by the Associated General Contractors  People are doing a lot more with a lot less Meli said  Costcutting concerns arent limited to major real estate companies and contractors Coops and condo board owners too are seeing costs of scaffolding and sidewalk sheds rise due to the citys facade inspection laws which were tightened in 2020 after Erica Tishman was killed by a piece of debris that fell from a 17story building in Midtown Following the death of Tishman a prominent architect the city ramped up inspections of buildings with facade violations and increased penalties for owners who fail to file facade inspections from 1000 to 5000 a year It also imposed base penalties of 1000 a year for owners who fail to correct unsafe conditions  Though building owners wont cut corners per se they may seek to delay facade repairs if city regulations allow it said Chris Alker the vice president of building operations at AKAM a building management company based in New York City But renting scaffolding for long periods of time increases the chance workers could get hurt  The longer scaffolding is up the longer work is happening the longer work is happening the higher propensity for risk Alker said More people are climbing on the building for a longer period of time and its a numbers game  While the safety inspection program is intended to protect pedestrians the work facade repairs entail can prove deadly Last month a worker fell to his death from an Upper West Side apartment that currently had permits open for facade repairs He was installing netting around a supported scaffold on the 15th floor of a 23story building when he fell to the sidewalk shed below  Attempts at reform met with opposition  While attempts have been made to address and prevent scaffolding fatalities many have stalled or been thwarted often due to the power and influence of New York Citys real estate developers  Carlos Moncayo a 22yearold Ecuadorian immigrant was buried alive in 2015 when a Manhattan construction site collapsed upon him As was the case with Chonillos fall two years later the contracting company found responsible for Moncayos death only paid 10000 in penalties Carloss Law the proposed bill named after Moncayo looks to raise corporate penalties to a minimum of 300000 for misdemeanors and 500000 for felonies involving a worker fatality or injury  I fought really really hard to move that bill in the Assembly said Moya the New York City Council member who introduced the law five years ago He characterized the mindset of New Yorks construction industry as people over profit Although the bill eventually was approved by the state legislature it was not without opposition from construction contractors afraid how it might increase their cost of doing business Its always been about the influence that the real estate community and insurance companies all had in Albany said Moya That was really preventing this legislation from coming through  One of the real estate industrys biggest lobbyists the Real Estate Board of New York initially opposed the bill over the potential liability of developers but later supported the law after its language was amended  Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn who cosponsored the bill and represents Brooklyns Flatbush and Midwood neighborhoods hopes Carloss Law will be a deterrent to construction companies who feel they can put workers in vulnerable circumstances without suffering legal consequences The issue is personal for Bichotte Hermelyn whose brother Wagner was disabled for life after falling seven stories from a scaffold on a New York City construction site 30 years ago We know scaffolding is one of the most dangerous and widely used devices in New York City she said Its temporary its high other elements like weather shoddy oversight and improper installation add to the danger  But the bill continues to face opposition from the developing community On June 30 the Building Trades Employers Association BTEA which represents 26 contractor associations across the US sent a letter to Hochul urging her to reconsider aspects of Carloss Law such as making the proposed fines a maximum instead of a minimum The BTEA did not respond to requests for comment    Legislators and construction experts say the strong ties between political figures and the contracting community has helped kill oversight and regulatory laws Since 2015 the BTEA has made nearly 240000 worth of campaign donations in New York State The largest contribution was a 40000 donation made to Andrew Cuomo during the 2018 gubernatorial election according to records from Open Secrets a website tracking campaign donations and lobbying  Meanwhile the New York chapter of American General Contractors a construction association poured more than 14000 into the 2021 to 2022 election cycle while the Real Estate Board of New York spent 160000 annually on lobbying between 2015 and 2019 Other groups representing contracting interests in New York such as New York Building Congress and the General Contractors Association of New York respectively spent 60000 and 30000 on lobbying in 2022  With an impasse in Albany regulatory agencies like the DOB and OSHA have also attempted to implement solutions to prevent fatal scaffolding falls throughout the city The DOB has run campaigns to raise awareness of the danger of working at heights including a facade and scaffold safety blitz in 2021 and last year the New York City Council passed a law prohibiting the use of standoff brackets a device used to install suspended scaffolds the DOB found had been a factor in safety incidents  After a surge of construction falls in 2017 New York City passed a law requiring construction workers at major job sites to earn site safety training SST cards which are needed to enter larger construction sites SST cards can be earned by taking OSHA training courses which include fall prevention and supported scaffold training  Every worker has to have the card said Chad Rynkiewicz vice president of Laborers Local 79 a New York construction union However his union often finds contractors who disregard the required hours looking to expedite work and bypass training costs Companies out there dont make workers sit through the classes they just issue the cards said Rynkiewicz  In January a widespread scheme to distribute fake identification documents including safety cards was uncovered after an investigation by the New York State Inspectors office of a construction site at Manhattans Javits Center A few months later the DOB revoked SST cards given out by EHS Academy which provided construction training courses after announcing the academy had failed to comply with the departments requirements for authorized course providers  And despite advancements that have been made over the years regarding scaffolding technology and tools aiming to decrease safety risks theyve largely been unimplemented according to Corrado the construction safety consultant People have invented posts lifelines various things to make scaffolding safer he said But again regulation would have to be changed  Introducing any new safety requirements in the entrenched industry would be like reinventing the wheel Corrado said  Update This story has been updated to include information on the Real Estate Board of New Yorks lobbying

right are reacting to a bill that supporters say would enhance protections for both gay rights and religious freedom  The Senate has advanced the Respect for Marriage Act RFMA past a key obstacle overcoming the filibuster with 62 votes last week including from 12 Republicans The legislation is expected to receive a final vote next week  There is some complaining on the left about the bill from voices with large audiences on social media But by and large the major LGBTQ advocacy groups back the bill  And even among those who have criticized the RFMA there is general agreement that they want the legislation to become law  I hate the Senate bill and we need it to pass wrote Charlotte Clymer a transgender author who worked for the Human Rights Campaign one of the nations largest gay rights organizations  Clymer argued that the bill does not codify gay marriage but noted it would protect the marriage licenses of gay couples who are married now if the US Supreme Court ever overturned the 2015 decision that legalized samesex unions Obergefell v Hodges  Charlotte Clymer speaks at a rally to support transgender troops in 2019 in Washington Joy AsicoAP Images for Human Rights Campaign  And Clymer said full federal recognition by Congress of gay marriage is not likely anytime soon as long as 60 votes are required to pass anything under the filibuster  But on the right opinions of the legislation are split There is a coalition of religious groups that back the bill or that back the religious liberty provisions and want the bill to pass despite their belief that their faith teachings do not allow them to support gay marriage  This group includes the National Association of Evangelicals the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America the Seventhday Adventist Church the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities the And Campaign and the 1st Amendment Partnership  Many of these groups think like religious minorities said Tim Schultz president of the 1st Amendment Partnership a religious freedom advocacy group So its not surprising that they seek pluralistic solutions to their challenges  Story continues  Many others dont think that way Schultz said in an interview on The Long Game a  podcast They do not think of themselves as a religious minority and they carry themselves in the public square very differently in ways that I think are actually part of the reason that they are achieving minority status  And in fact there is vociferous resistance to the marriage legislation from a number of prominent social conservatives and the opposition of many is absolute This group includes the US Conference of Catholic Bishops Franklin Graham of Samaritans Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Ryan T Anderson at the Ethics and Public Policy Center the Missouri Baptist Convention and other figures who work for institutions like the Heritage Foundation Alliance Defending Freedom and World magazine an evangelical publication  Anderson outlined the absolutist case against the Senate bill last week  A protester outside the Supreme Court in 2017 Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty Images  Marriage is a natural and supernatural institution before it is a political institution Human law should reflect the natural law and eternal law No Senator should vote to allow the government to redefine what marriage is Anderson tweeted  When Anderson was asked on Twitter if he would support a bill with even more expansive protections for religious freedom along the lines of an amendment proposed by Sen Mike Lee RUtah he said he would not even though he favored the Lee amendment and said it offered meaningful religious liberty protections  Critics of Lee say he has done little to work constructively toward a compromise on these issues Lee spokesman Lee Lonsberry told  that the senator attempted repeatedly to engage all involved in negotiations on the marriage bill but did not answer a question about what form those attempts took or when he made them  His proposed amendment to the Respect for Marriage Act has been developed over a long period of time and with input from a wide range of religious organizations and individuals Lonsberry said  Schultz said that the intent of the RFMA is to reassure both sides that their worst fears will not be realized by crafting protections for each  Schultz like many on the right does not think its at all likely that the Supreme Court would overturn Obergefell He sees Justice Clarence Thomass opinion in the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v Wade  in which Thomas raised the possibility of doing away with samesex marriage  as an outlier  But I guess I would say this For people who are worried about Obergefell being overturned we ought to have good faith and try to make sure they understand that those marriages that have been legally entered into arent going to be nullified Schultz said  Utah Republican Sen Mike Lee at an election night party on Nov 8 in Salt Lake City Rick BowmerAP  The RFMA ensures that if Obergefell were overturned marriage licenses would still be valid and states that have legalized gay marriage would still be able to issue licenses in the future Further those licenses would have to be recognized in states where gay marriage is not enshrined in law  And I think its the same spirit that I appreciate that supporters of samesex marriage have said Oh youre meaning religious organizations worried that youre going to lose your taxexempt status We think thats really unlikely but guess what were going to say were not going to do that Schultz said  So some of this is really saying to each other I think the risk of what youre worried about is pretty low but how about we make sure that you dont have to worry about it at all he told   Conservative author David French wrote that each side has a moment in the past few years that haunts them For conservatives it is thenPresident Barack Obamas solicitor general Donald Verrilli saying in oral arguments in 2015 that a college that opposed samesex marriage could be treated by the federal government in the same way that the IRS stripped Bob Jones University of its taxexempt status for opposing interracial marriage and dating For liberals it is Thomass opinion about overturning Obergefell  Some on the right argue that the RFMA does make it more likely that religious organizations could lose their taxexempt status if they refuse to hire a gay person or could lose grants or accreditation if they choose not to open up adoptions to gay couples for example  Plaintiff Jim Obergefell holds a photo of his late husband John Arthur after the Supreme Court handed down a ruling regarding samesex marriage on June 26 2015 Alex WongGetty Images  But that claim is disregarding the statutory text according to a group of conservative legal scholars led by Douglas Laycock a University of Virginia law professor who has successfully argued significant religious freedom cases at the US Supreme Court in recent years  Laycock and three other constitutional law scholars said that the RFMA is a good and important step for the liberty of believers to follow their traditional views of marriage  Its protections for religious liberty while not comprehensive are important especially in the context in which RFMA arises Laycock and the other experts wrote  The Laycock letter also noted that both gay rights and religious freedom advocates have failed to advance their causes when they have refused to engage in compromise  The law scholars noted that Lees effort in 2015 to pass a more expansive religious liberty bill the First Amendment Defense Act could not get 60 votes in the Senate despite the fact that Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress The bill would have protected organizations opposed to samesex marriage or homosexuality in general from discriminatory action by the federal government among other provisions  Laycock and his fellow scholars say that Lees 2015 bill failed because it did not include protections for LGBTQ people  LGBTQrights proponents have failed to secure their goals in Congress through the Equality Act or in many state legislatures because they have been unwilling to make provision for religious liberty the conservative legal scholars wrote The lesson applies to conservatives as well Efforts like the First Amendment Defense Act FADA have likewise failed repeatedly because they made no provision for recognizing LGBTQ rights even in an incremental way  Lee at a committee hearing in 2016 Mark WilsonGetty Images  Religious liberty has been caught in the crossfire of warring groups unwilling to accept the smallest gain for the other side And religious liberty has suffered as a result they wrote This bill offers a chance to counter those trends and to enact religiousliberty protections in a bipartisan measure  Matthew Lee Anderson founder of the conservative Mere Orthodoxy website wrote that these are not the only religious liberty protections we need at all  Yet the gains here are not negligible either he added What is lost is  well the answer to that depends on how realistic it is to think that Obergefell will be overturned within the next 10 years  I think I understand why the Religious Right is opposed to RFMA What I do not understand is regarding that political judgment as so obvious that any conservative who supports it has somehow departed from conservatism much less Christian orthodoxy he concluded  Cover thumbnail photo illustration  photo Jacquelyn MartinAP', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

       " {'guid': 486, 'text_a': 'Before relinquishing or delaying their ambitions these potential challengers should refresh themselves on two important features of the last generation of presidential history  The first is that four out of the last five presidents reached the office only after ignoring the consensus view outward indications or prevailing wisdom about their prospects The willingness to defy smartset assumptions may be among the most important qualifications for the job  The second is that when the electorate is eager for change it usually finds a way to get it This suggests someone is going to try thisand do better than many people expect  This was the case with Bill Clinton He took the Democratic nomination in 1992 only after more established and seemingly formidable figures in his party declined to run apparently on the belief  which seemed plausible enough a year before election  that incumbent President George HW Bush in the wake of the successful first Gulf War was a prohibitive favorite for a second term  That was the case also with Barack Obama He announced his 2008 candidacy while still a newcomer to the US Senate declining to bow to the widespread belief that the Democratic nomination surely belonged to the betterknown Hillary Rodham Clinton  Eight years later the defier of conventional wisdom became its enforcer Obama was the most important Democratic voice nudging his vice president out of seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016 This time it really was Hillary Clintons turn nearly everyone believed One of the dissenters was Donald Trump  perhaps the supreme example of how it pays to be contemptuous of the establishment certitudes of both parties  The last example is Biden himself As late as February 2020 the very same voices who lately have pronounced him probably unstoppable for another nomination regarded him as a pathetic figure  how sad that he was ending a decadeslong career with a string of primary losses Wouldnt it be more dignified if he would gracefully step aside  This time all manner of ambitious nextgeneration Democrats from Gavin Newsom in California to Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan along with many others have stayed out of the race in deference to Biden The logic seemingly has two pillars The first is that Biden  in the wake of Democrats betterthanhistoricalaverage performance in the recent midterm elections  is actually much stronger than earlier supposed The second is that when incumbent presidents are challenged within their own party that usually helps the opposition party in the general election  Both pillars seem wobbly It is true that Democrats outperformed expectations last month and also true that younger voters came out in higher numbers than usual in midterms It is also true that Biden was not welcomed by Democrats to campaign for them in most closely contested races His approval ratings typically in the low forties are weakest among younger voters Nor was Election Day filled with dire portents for Republicans willing to separate themselves from Trump Republican governors who established their distance from Trump in Ohio and Georgia won easily as did Florida Gov Ron DeSantis who has drawn Trumps ire even while striking the same chords of populist resentment that fueled Trumps movement Their success in electoralpowerhouse states does not suggest an easy presidential election for Democrats two years from now  As for the conventional view that nomination contests are bad for incumbent presidents  such as Jimmy Carter in 1980 or Bush in 1992  it is more likely that these presidents are challenged because they are weak rather than that nomination contests left them fatally weakened  As for Trump the current assumption is that he could lose the GOP nomination to somebody  perhaps DeSantis  but would probably win it if he is challenged by a bunch of somebodies splitting the antiTrump vote  Collectively this has created a situation that my colleague Jonathan Martin channeling Oscar Wilde calls the bipartisan truth that dare not speak its name Many people in both parties want to shoo leaders off the stage but cant summon the courage to do so  It calls to mind the first time in the modern era that the political class was consumed with whether an incumbent president could be challenged Early in 1968 Robert Kennedy was agonizing over whether he had made a mistake in not running against incumbent Lyndon B Johnson Another Democrat Eugene McCarthy was gaining momentum on an antiVietnam War platform winning support from voters that Kennedy believed were naturally his He wanted to hear from an esteemed voice from an earlier generation the aging columnist Walter Lippmann In an exchange documented by biographers of both men Kennedy made the case why LBJs war policies were a disaster Then he made the case why a nomination challenge would probably be futile  Lippmann just listened quietly until Kennedy asked him directly what he thought Well Lippmann replied if you believe that Johnsons reelection would be a catastrophe for the country  and I entirely agree with you on this  then the question you must live with is whether you did everything you could to avert this catastrophe  Kennedy ultimately did run before an assassin stopped his campaign in June 1968 Lippmanns question however is one that should echo with every politician who thinks he or she should be a president than either Biden or Trump  all while biding time on the sidelines', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

6 committees unanimous vote Monday to refer Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution of inciting insurrection and other federal crimes was historic For the first time Congress has urged criminal prosecution against a former or current chief executive  The congressional Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol which held its final public meeting Monday was in many ways a pathbreaking legislative effort  Its slick production raised the standard for hearing presentations Its investigations produced volumes of evidence implicating former President Donald Trump and his allies It kept the issue of culpability for the attacks in the media glare  Its vote to refer Mr Trump to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution of inciting insurrection and other federal crimes was historic For the first time Congress has urged criminal prosecution against a former or current US chief executive  Why We Wrote This The Jan 6 committee seems to have aimed its work at history rather than the shortterm political cycle On Monday it made some of its own for the first time recommending that a former president be prosecuted on criminal charges  But the panels most lasting legacy may be its story After all this time it is still shocking to hear the details of the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and its culmination in a mob smashing its way into the US Capitol  Brick by brick the Jan 6 panel has constructed an epic tale from the former president seemingly offthecuff claiming he had actually won on the night of the election to shouting matches in the Oval Office over false claims of election fraud to Mr Trumps nonresponsiveness as the Capitol riot commenced  We dont know what history will say about this period of American politics But the Jan 6 documentation appears to be the kind of evidence on which history is based  In that sense the hearings were reminiscent of other noteworthy efforts such as the Senate Watergate committee or the ArmyMcCarthy hearings of 1954 says Joanne Freeman professor of American history at Yale University and author of The Field of Blood Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War  What resonates again and again and again in these public moments  is if theres a way to get a broad sweep of the public to see whats happening to think about whats happening and to watch at least some people stand up and say That crossed the line thats really important says Professor Freeman  No one should get a pass  Still the vote to recommend that Attorney General Merrick Garland prosecute Mr Trump was the emphatic ending point to the Jan 6 committees work Possible charges listed were inciting insurrection conspiracy to defraud the United States obstruction of Congress and conspiracy to make a false statement  The panel also referred for possible prosecution five allies of Mr Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyers Rudolph Giuliani John Eastman Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro  The committee believes there is evidence Mr Trump committed serious crimes and if the Justice Department concurs then he should be charged as other Americans would be said Rep Adam Schiff Democrat of California in a hallway interview with reporters following the hearing  No one should get a pass The day we start giving passes to presidents or former presidents or people in power  is the day we can say that this was the beginning of the end of our democracy said Representative Schiff  Jonathan ErnstReuters Democratic Rep Jamie Raskin of Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

COVID wave Getty Images  After what seemed a relatively stable fall season COVID19 is on the rise once again all across the United States just before Americans prepare to celebrate the holidays  In the past two weeks COVID cases and hospitalizations have jumped more than 25 Test positivity rates ICU admissions and the levels of virus detected in wastewater have also increased at a national level These are signs experts say that we may be entering a new COVID wave  Rochelle Walensky director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at a press briefing on Monday that this rise in cases and hospitalizations is especially worrisome as we move into the winter months when more people are assembling indoors with less ventilation and as we approach the holiday season where many are gathering with loved ones across multiple generations  The timing of this uptick in COVID activity is also concerning given that many health systems across the US are already dealing with an overwhelming number of patients stricken with RSV and influenza infections  Why are COVID19 cases on the rise  Winter is typically a busy time for hospitals because it is when many respiratory viruses emerge and more people especially in cold weather areas spend more time indoors This gives respiratory viruses including COVID19 more chance of spreading  Before Thanksgiving many experts predicted that an uptick in cases after the holiday could be expected especially since many people have stopped taking measures to mitigate the spread of the virus such as masking  Dr Michael Chang a pediatric infectious disease expert at UTHealth Houston and Childrens Memorial Hermann Hospital told  that while gathering for Thanksgiving may have contributed to the recent rise in COVID19 cases changes in the virus itself are probably driving this wave of infections  The coronavirus has continued to mutate and two new Omicron subvariants  known as BQ1 and BQ11  have now become dominant in the US Both of these have replaced BA5 the Omicron subvariant that had dominated infections in the US since the summer Together they now account for 62 of cases nationwide  Story continues  These variants are much more contagious than Omicron BA5 They are even more immuneevasive than Omicron BA5 unfortunately Chang said This means the new variants have the ability to bypass immunity acquired by vaccination treatments and prior infection  But Chang is optimistic that BQ1 and BQ11 wont have as severe an impact as previous variants Based on other countries experience of them he said it appears there isnt as much severe illness and hospitalization associated with them  He also explained that many Americans have some immunity from vaccination a recent Omicron infection or both Although this immunity may not be as strong against these new variants he said that for many people particularly the young and healthy it will still be enough protection against the most severe outcomes of the disease  Over the last few surges what weve seen is a decreasing trend So even though we have a large number of cases the number of cases that results in hospitalization and severe illness is not as high and I think thats going to be true for these new variants as well Chang said  Another factor experts say is contributing to the recent spike in COVID hospitalizations is waning vaccine protection The shots have been shown to lose their effectiveness over time This is why boosters are necessary to restore protection and are particularly important for those with the highest risk for severe COVID outcomes So far only 127 of eligible Americans have gotten the new bivalent booster according to CDC data  Empty shelves where cold and flu medicine are usually stocked in a CVS pharmacy in Burbank Calif on Tuesday Mario TamaGetty Images  Those 65 and older are most at risk of hospitalization  Although a rise in hospitalizations has been noted in all age groups the majority of COVID19 hospitalizations in recent weeks have been among older adults particularly those who have not received a booster shot in the past six months  Older people in our population above 65 especially those above 85 years of age Chang told  were starting to see an increasing percentage of severe illness and hospitalizations and deaths in that age group again  Immunity from the vaccines is not longlasting in this age group because of how the immune system works and an unfortunate consequence of aging Chang said  In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of CDC data researchers found that more of the deaths in recent months have been among seniors who were vaccinated but not boosted According to CDC data only 326 of adults 65 and older have received the bivalent booster since it became available three months ago  I think certainly older Americans who are not up to date on their vaccinations need to get up to date on their SARSCoV2 vaccinations as soon as possible including getting the bivalent booster Chang said  The bivalent booster offers the highest protection against COVID right now  On Monday Walensky emphasized how important it is for all Americans who are eligible for the bivalent booster to receive it this season She said those who have received only their primary series are considered fully vaccinated but they are not considered fully protected against severe disease this winter  The new bivalent booster she said is the highest defense against COVID19 severe disease at the moment The shot approved in September by the CDC was developed to target the BA4 and BA5 Omicron variants as well as the original strain of the virus  According to the agency people 12 and older who have had a bivalent booster shot have a 15 times lower risk of death than an unvaccinated person A recent CDC study also showed that the bivalent booster provided significant additional protection against infection in people who had previously received two three or four doses of the original vaccine monovalent Although it isnt clear yet how effective the shot is against BQ1 and BQ11 vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer have said their updated boosters work against these new variants  The CDC recommends that people 5 years and older receive the bivalent booster if it has been at least two months since their last vaccination whether that was the last dose of a primary series or an original booster  On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration also authorized the bivalent booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer for children as young as 6 months The FDA said in a statement that it is important to get young children vaccinated ahead of the holidays and winter months  Children between 6 months and 5 years old who received the Moderna twodose primary series can now receive Modernas bivalent booster two months after their second shot Similarly kids between 6 months and 4 years of age who have received two doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine can get the companies bivalent booster as a third shot Children in the same age group who have completed Pfizers threedose primary series however are not eligible to get this booster right now The FDA said it needed to evaluate more data to approve the shots for children in this group and that an update could come after January  The bivalent booster shot ramps up to a high level of protection in about a week and offers the highest protection within two weeks so experts recommend that people get vaccinated as soon as possible to be best protected before they travel and gather for the holidays  Tanvi Nayak 22 gets a bivalent COVID19 booster from a pharmacist Morgan Murphy at a CVS store in Chicago on Oct 13 Antonio PerezChicago TribuneTribune News Service via Getty Images  Other ways to stay protected against COVID19 this winter  Besides being up to date with their COVID19 vaccinations and getting the bivalent booster Chang said there are other steps people can take to prevent infection  One is staying home if you feel sick I know most people are looking forward to visiting with their friends and family but if youre symptomatic at all  you know sore throat runny nose even if you think its just a cold  I strongly recommend trying to stay home trying to avoid going out again he said  According to CDC guidance everyone who tests positive for the virus regardless of vaccination status should isolate at home for five days If symptoms resolve after that time you can leave isolation but should consider wearing a mask around others for five additional days  The CDC continues to recommend masking for residents of counties that have high community levels of COVID19 as well as for anyone who may be immunocompromised or at increased risk of severe disease People traveling by plane or taking any form of public transportation should also consider masking Walensky said  Improving ventilation and minimizing the size of gatherings whenever possible is also wise Chang advises  Finally Walensky encouraged Americans if they test positive for COVID19 to reach out to their health care provider immediately for early care Some treatments are available including the antiviral medication Paxlovid which if given within the first few days of illness can shorten the duration and severity of the disease All adults and children ages 12 and older are eligible for Paxlovid but the CDC recommends first consulting a doctor to help decide which of the treatments available if any is right for you  If you are still not sure what to do if you test positive for COVID this holiday season the CDC has a stepbystep guide with advice on what to do and a list of resources available to everyone for protecting against the virus', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

in at least 2250 police and sheriffs departments are missing from the past seven years of federal records according to an analysis of the database maintained by The Post which began tracking the killings in 2015 The excluded data has created a misleading government picture of police use of force complicating efforts at accountability  The incomplete data also obscures a racial discrepancy among those killed by police that is larger than the federal data suggests Black people are fatally shot by police far more often than is evident in the FBI data The Post has found  at more than double the rate for White people  Among the missing data shootings by officers in 440 departments whose local governments received nearly 90 million in federal grants to track and report crime data and shootings from another 700 departments required by local laws to report the killings to state authorities but no higher  In at least 34 states laws require police to report crime data to the state But most of the laws are vague about whether police shootings must be included offering minimal accountability at the state or local level The Post found In California for example only half of departments fatal police shootings appear in the FBI data  Boston was among the larger departments with missing data The Post documented 11 fatal shootings by its officers since 2015 but none of those are recorded in the FBIs records The Chicago Police Department reported six officerinvolved fatal shootings but The Post logged 45 Police in Boise Idaho fatally shot 12 people whose deaths were not

including those by officers on duty  so that the information can be used for research and be made available to the public But compliance is mandatory only for federal law enforcement The Post found that only about 290 local departments reported all fatal police shootings to the FBI since 2015  The decline in reporting is driven by multiple factors In many cases departments simply choose not to report fatal police shootings to the FBI In others departments are required by law to send data to state officials who neglect to forward it to the FBI About a dozen departments told The Post they had failed to report shootings because of clerical errors and would improve their process  In New Mexico Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe said he incorrectly assumed that other departments that are called in to investigate his officers shootings would report the homicides Farmington police fatally shot four people over seven years Not one of those is listed in the FBIs public database  What we wound up learning is that we need to change how were reporting Hebbe told The Post adding If its our action we need to be reporting it  In recent years departments contributions to federal data have dwindled as the FBI transitions to a more detailed reporting system The bureau said it rejects data that isnt properly formatted  Criminologists say that a lack of accurate FBI data makes it difficult to know the full scope of police use of deadly force despite renewed scrutiny that began with the shooting death of 18yearold Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson Mo  Experts say that the FBIs flawed data conceals other patterns that could help the Justice Department identify troubled departments  and lead to reforms A high rate of police shootings relative to other departments of a similar size could be a sign that an agencys officers need additional training said Jacob Kaplan a criminologist at Princeton University  Without this kind of data its hard to have the foresight of which agencies are going to have a problem Kaplan said  In the California town of Vallejo population 120000 police have fatally shot six people in the past seven years FBI records do not include any of them  One of the people shot was Willie McCoy a 20yearold rapper who performed under the stage name Willie Bo In 2019 police found McCoy either asleep or unconscious in his car in the drivethrough lane of a fastfood restaurant with a gun in his lap according to a special prosecutors report on the shooting Officers ordered McCoy to show his hands the report said Officers said that when McCoy awoke they thought he was reaching for the gun They fired 55 times killing him  Deyana Jenkins 20 holds a portrait of her late uncle Willie McCoy at her family home in Hercules Calif on April 30 2019 Yalonda M

law requires that fatal police shootings be reported to the state The state attorney generals office then sends data to the FBI Vallejo police did not respond to requests for comment  The attorney generals office said it relies on departments to report accurately and follows up to offer support but the law has no penalty for noncompliant departments The Post found that 500 fatal shootings in California  nearly half of the states total since 2015  were missing from the FBI database  The racial disparity in fatal police shootings in California is far larger than the nationwide disparity The Post has found Black people in the state are killed by police at nearly four times the rate of White people  In Vallejo two of the people killed by police were Black McCoy being one of them Three were Hispanic and one was White  McCoys brother Kori said the FBI records fail to capture the true picture of Vallejo police The sirens should have been ringing years and years ago he said  Taking funds despite unreported deaths  The FBI has been collecting summarized statistics from police departments since the 1930s including through its Uniform Crime Reporting Program or UCR  In the 1980s the bureau introduced the National IncidentBased Reporting System to collect more details including victim demographics and in recent years has shifted departments to this program But as with the UCR the new program is mandatory only for federal law enforcement agencies and most local departments do not participate  As an incentive the Justice Department distributes about 285 million annually through the Justice Assistance Grant program State and local governments which pass the money on to area police and sheriffs departments receive their share according to a formula that considers the amount of crime police departments report and the local populations  Departments must report at least three years of homicide and other major crime data to be eligible for funding The data does not have to be complete for departments to receive money said Tannyr Watkins a spokeswoman for the Office of Justice Programs However she said missing information may result in smaller grant awards  On average each year about 1400 local jurisdictions are allocated funding under the program Within those 440 departments had no fatal shootings by police reported in the past seven years but The Post found they had shot and killed nearly 1300 people in that time Their local governments received nearly 86 million in that time  The Justice Department also offers funding to help police and sheriffs departments upgrade their computer systems to establish or enhance their participation in crime data reporting There are no provisions in the grant for withholding funds  The Post identified six departments  including the city of Bostons and smaller sheriffs departments  whose jurisdictions received nearly 26 million from the program between 2015 and 2021 yet their fatal police shootings are not included in the FBI data  Boston police received the bulk of that funding  about 22 million  in 2016 Since then Boston officers have shot and killed 10 people whose deaths are not recorded in the FBI database  Mariellen Burns a spokeswoman for the Boston Police Department said that one of those shootings occurred in another jurisdiction and six had only recently been ruled justified by the district attorney When those came through a step was missed and they werent updated she said The remaining three are still under investigation Were definitely going to have training reminders and refreshers for those who are responsible for this type of reporting she said adding that it was helpful for the department to be made aware of the missing data Were not going to get better unless we look at how we can improve  Some departments balk at reporting fatal shootings by police alongside homicides by civilians because most officers killings are ruled justified criminologists said The FBI records fatal shootings by police as justifiable homicidesofficer involved  Its been a longrunning discussion said Michael C Walker a criminologist and former police chief in New Jersey Justifiable homicide is not a crime so why is it housed in this publication called Crime in the United States In some cases officerinvolved homicides are proved to be crimes such as the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis  At a meeting in Pittsburgh this year an advisory subcommittee for the FBIs data collection program considered a proposal from some in law enforcement to exclude fatal shootings by police from the public database  and submit them instead to an internal FBI collection Some information eventually would be made public but only in summary form  The group ultimately rejected the idea If the FBI stops reporting it its going to look like theyre trying to hide the data said Princetons Kaplan who along with Walker is a member of the committee I dont see a benefit to switching  Loopholes lax reporting and no enforcement  An image taken from police dashboardcamera video shows Glen Allen White holding a knife shortly before he was fatally shot by a sheriffs deputy in Pope County Ark in 2020 Courtesy of Pope County Sheriffs Office  The lack of accountability on the state and local level is at the root of the missing FBI data In Kansas for example departments must report all felony and misdemeanor offenses to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation which said it sends the data to the FBI The handbook on reporting data to the state notes that departments are required to report justifiable homicides  But the state bureau interprets the law to exclude them Since a Justifiable Homicide isnt a crime there is no felony or misdemeanor offense to report Melissa Underwood a spokeswoman for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in an email  Only two departments in the state have fatal shootings in the database leaving more than 60 deaths unreported over the past seven years  As of 2021 at least 14 states had laws that specifically required reporting of fatal police shootings to the state Of those five state agencies told The Post that they voluntarily forward data they receive to the FBIs public database  Virginia is the only state that requires a state agency to report local departments fatal police shootings to the FBI database Still The Post found that 63 fatal shootings by officers in 43 departments in that state are missing from the FBI data  We VSP dont know what we dont know Keon Turner a data analyst for the Virginia State Police said in an email The onus is on the agencies to enter the information at their level and forward it to us  Story continues below advertisement Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement Advertisement  A few states have consequences for failing to report but those repercussions are often vague and state agencies rarely if ever enforce them The Post found no departments that had been penalized for noncompliance  In Pennsylvania a 2004 law requires departments to report all offenses to the state police The state police which sends the data to the FBI said it interprets the law to include fatal shootings by police  Although the law specifies that funding should be withheld for noncompliance state police said they are unaware of any departments having been penalized Departments typically comply said Myles Snyder a spokesman for state police  But more than 50 fatal shootings by Pennsylvania police departments are missing from FBI data over seven years Snyder said some departments have not switched to the FBIs new reporting system whose format he said prevented the state from forwarding those departments data Pennsylvania law does not require police to transition to the new reporting system  For those grieving after a deadly shooting by police the realization that their loved one remains uncounted by the FBI deepens the pain of their loss  He wasnt just a nothing He was a person and they killed him said Michelle White Her brother Glen Allen White was fatally shot by a sheriffs deputy in Pope County Ark in 2020  Glen Allen White Family Photo  White 53 was drunk and distraught when family members called authorities for help A deputy who arrived at the familys home readied his Taser while White pulled out a folding knife according to a report by the county prosecutor White approached and the deputy holstered his Taser and instead drew his gun  The deputy yelled at White to stop moving and then fired four shots the report said Whites body crumpled on the dirt road  The prosecutor declined to press charges determining that the shooting was justified because the officer believed that a Taser could not have stopped White as he walked toward him with a knife  White is one of three people shot and killed by Pope County deputies over the past seven years All three shootings are absent from FBI records  Asked about the omissions Sgt Rodney McNeese a spokesman for the sheriffs office said Arkansas State Police investigates the deputies shootings and should report them to the FBI  Arkansas does not have a law explicitly mandating that departments report their fatal shootings but the FBI asks that the agency in the jurisdiction where a shooting occurred submit the data  Regardless of whose job it was to report Michelle White feels that her brothers shooting should have been counted

Congress has urged criminal prosecution against a former or current chief executive  The congressional Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol which held its final public meeting Monday was in many ways a pathbreaking legislative effort  Its slick production raised the standard for hearing presentations Its investigations produced volumes of evidence implicating former President Donald Trump and his allies It kept the issue of culpability for the attacks in the media glare  Its vote to refer Mr Trump to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution of inciting insurrection and other federal crimes was historic For the first time Congress has urged criminal prosecution against a former or current US chief executive  Why We Wrote This The Jan 6 committee seems to have aimed its work at history rather than the shortterm political cycle On Monday it made some of its own for the first time recommending that a former president be prosecuted on criminal charges  But the panels most lasting legacy may be its story After all this time it is still shocking to hear the details of the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and its culmination in a mob smashing its way into the US Capitol  Brick by brick the Jan 6 panel has constructed an epic tale from the former president seemingly offthecuff claiming he had actually won on the night of the election to shouting matches in the Oval Office over false claims of election fraud to Mr Trumps nonresponsiveness as the Capitol riot commenced  We dont know what history will say about this period of American politics But the Jan 6 documentation appears to be the kind of evidence on which history is based  In that sense the hearings were reminiscent of other noteworthy efforts such as the Senate Watergate committee or the ArmyMcCarthy hearings of 1954 says Joanne Freeman professor of American history at Yale University and author of The Field of Blood Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War  What resonates again and again and again in these public moments  is if theres a way to get a broad sweep of the public to see whats happening to think about whats happening and to watch at least some people stand up and say That crossed the line thats really important says Professor Freeman  No one should get a pass  Still the vote to recommend that Attorney General Merrick Garland prosecute Mr Trump was the emphatic ending point to the Jan 6 committees work Possible charges listed were inciting insurrection conspiracy to defraud the United States obstruction of Congress and conspiracy to make a false statement  The panel also referred for possible prosecution five allies of Mr Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyers Rudolph Giuliani John Eastman Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro  The committee believes there is evidence Mr Trump committed serious crimes and if the Justice Department concurs then he should be charged as other Americans would be said Rep Adam Schiff Democrat of California in a hallway interview with reporters following the hearing  No one should get a pass The day we start giving passes to presidents or former presidents or people in power  is the day we can say that this was the beginning of the end of our democracy said Representative Schiff  Jonathan ErnstReuters Democratic Rep Jamie Raskin of Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

meeting was to take place according to multiple members  The council members who provided images of the email from Twitter to The  spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retaliation The

after buying Twitter for 44 billion in late October Musk said he would form a new content moderation council to help make major decisions but later changed his mind  Twitters Trust and Safety Council was a group of volunteers who over many years gave up their time when consulted by Twitter staff to offer advice on a wide range of online harms and safety issues  tweeted council member Alex Holmes

after Musk amplified criticism of them and Twitters past leadership for allegedly not doing enough to stop child sexual exploitation on the platform  ADVERTISEMENT  It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years Musk tweeted  A growing number of attacks on the council led to concerns from some remaining members who sent an email to Twitter earlier on Monday

equal  A new study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open analyzed firearm deaths over the past three decades  a total of more than 1 million lives lost since 1990 The researchers found that firearm mortality rates increased for most demographic groups in recent years  especially during the pandemic  and vast disparities persisted  While recent data shows some familiar patterns the sheer scale of the issue brings the United States to a new moment in the history of firearm fatalities said Dr Eric Fleegler a pediatric emergency physician and researcher with Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School and coauthor of the study  At this moment in time we have seen a dramatic increase that is really unparalleled he said During the time of the Covid pandemic going from 2019 up to 2021 weve seen over a 25 increase in fatalities in two years alone That has never happened  Overall men are significantly more at risk Nearly 86 of all firearm deaths since 1990 have been among men according to the study which used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The researchers found that firearm homicides were highest among Black men and firearm suicide rates were highest among senior White men  Rates of firearm homicide for both men and women nearly doubled between 2014 and 2021 but men were still more than five times more likely to die than women Rates of firearm suicide were also seven times higher among men than women in 2021 despite increasing suicide rates among women over time  The racial disparities are even starker The homicide rate among young Black men  142 homicide deaths for every 100000 Black men ages 20 to 24  was nearly 10 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in the US in 2021  Homicide rates among Black and Hispanic men were highest in the 20 to 24 age group But for White men the rate was highest in the 30 to 34 age group When comparing these groups the homicide rate was nearly four times higher among young Hispanic men compared with White men and the homicide rate among young Black men was a staggering 22 times higher than among White men  When we think about bad disparities were often thinking about a 20 increase or a 50 increase With infant mortality in the United States when you look at Black infants versus White infants theres over a twofold difference in mortality rate And that is a huge number to think about Fleegler said And here were talking over 20fold These are orders of magnitude differences that are just worsening And they demand that type of attention  Video Ad Feedback Two doctors say stop blaming mental health for mass shootings 0515  Source   A countylevel analysis showed that firearm mortality shifted from the West to the South over time as firearm homicide rates remained concentrated and growing in the South and firearm suicide rates spread more evenly across the country  Urban areas had a higher burden of firearm mortality than rural areas too  There are two key factors driving community gun violence says Jonathan Jay an assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health disadvantage at the neighborhood level and exposure to gun violence at the individual level  Gun violence is most likely in spaces that show signs of physical disinvestment Sometimes that looks like unkempt vacant lots or abandoned houses that are boarded up maybe a high density of liquor stores and a low density of healthy food options he said  For Jay who received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the racial disparities in gun injuries among US youth its not surprising that patterns in firearm fatality rates only got worse  because the pandemic only exacerbated existing disparities  It makes sense that the worst early impacts would be in neighborhoods that faced the highest disadvantage and impacts of segregation before the pandemic he said Some people have talked about it like a mystery as to why gun violence would stay high even as things change in the pandemic I think one possible explanation is just that things  social conditions  havent changed that much  But also the pandemic exposed people to lots of things that made them feel unsafe and may have made individuals more likely to feel like they needed to carry a weapon for protection he said  Mental health challenges grew throughout the pandemic and violence increased but a separate analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that guns made those things significantly more deadly Between 2019 and 2021 all of the increase in suicides and most of the increase in homicides was due to guns The gun suicide rate increased 10 while the nongun suicide rate decreased by 8 and the gun homicide rate increased 45 while the nongun homicide rate increased only 6  What weve seen is that the economic and social stressors during Covid have exacerbated health disparities across the spectrum said Ari Davis a policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Gun Violence Solutions  The same same stressors  social isolation cutting social services and support  are risk factors for violence I think all those things contributed to a rise across the board but disproportionately burdening those who are most vulnerable  The research published in Tuesday confirmed much of what we already know researchers from the University of Michigan wrote in a related editorial  theres a broad gender difference an urbanrural divide and racial disparities in firearm mortality rates in the US  This burden is not distributed equally and recent increases in firearm mortality rates are most pronounced among the demographic groups and regions that were already among the most affected they wrote  But the analysis helps

       " {'guid': 1538, 'text_a': '   President Joe Biden on Tuesday used the latest mass shooting to offer his most vocal push for gun control since taking office saying the deaths of 10 people at a grocery store in Colorado should jolt Washington and the nation into action  It was a message past presidents have also wielded to disappointing results But Biden  who has a lengthy and mixed record on the issue  signaled he was ready to press for legislation even as he balances other priorities in Congress  In somber remarks from the White House State Dining Room he said he would do everything in his power to keep Americans safe and pushed a pair of Housepassed gun reforms including a universal background checks measure and an assault weapons ban  After acknowledging there were still outstanding details to be learned about Mondays massacre including the shooters motive and weapons Biden insisted enough was known to make an ardent call for new gun control  I dont need to wait another minute let alone an hour to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future he said listing a ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines as well as strengthening the background check system by closing loopholes as areas he would like to see Congress act  This is not  it should not be  a partisan issue This is an American issue he said It will save lives American lives We have to act  Yet the complications in pushing for gun control at a moment when a number of other legislative priorities are looming was immediately apparent Biden departed the White House directly following his remarks for a visit to Ohio where he is promoting the 19 trillion stimulus measure passed earlier this month Aides are also preparing an infrastructure package that is expected to be unveiled soon  Asked during his tour of the oncology department at The Ohio State University whether he believed he had the political capital to move ahead with gun control Biden crossed his fingers  I hope so I dont know he said I havent done any counting yet  Biden noted on Tuesday that the White House flag was still flying a halfstaff to honor the victims of last weeks shooting in Atlanta when the Colorado incident occurred He ordered it lowered again  The President had made no mention of gun control in the aftermath of the Atlanta shooting  including during remarks after visiting the city  choosing to focus instead on a recent spate of violent crimes committed against AsianAmericans  But he faced increasing pressure to voice an opinion on the matter after another mass killing in Colorado  Earlier Tuesday Vice President Kamala Harris called the shooting absolutely tragic but ignored a question about the future of gun control during a swearingin ceremony for William Burns as CIA director  As the nations posture on guns has evolved Biden has been frontandcenter at most every stop along the way for more than three decades from the triumph of a 10year ban on assault weapons in 1994 to the disappointment of a failed push for universal background checks in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre  But now Biden commands a bully pulpit that hes never had in the debate over guns in America facing the challenge of how  or whether  to wield the power of the White House to try and make some type of gun reform legislation a reality  The shootings in Georgia and Colorado come in the first chapter of his presidency prompting a discussion inside the West Wing over how much political capital Biden should expend on the matter which has so often ended in frustration But the debate comes at a time when the powerful gun lobby is divided and weakened creating what some allies see as a possible opening for Biden  Nothing frustrated President Obama more than his failure to achieve gun reform but Biden may have the chance to do something Obama just couldnt do a top aide to Obama told  speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Obamas limitations on the matter Biden is not seen as threatening to some people in a way Obama sadly was  Its an open question the degree to which Biden wants a debate over guns to consume the political oxygen in his first year with Covid19 relief only beginning to take hold and a massive infrastructure bill next up on the agenda Yet with two mass shootings in the last week alone aides know it may be a choice already made for Biden  Meeting with advocates  The Presidents team has met with gun control advocates over the past two months to discuss potential executive actions and to generate ideas on potential paths forward according to people familiar with the meetings Those meetings have been led by Susan Rice director of the Domestic Policy Council and Cedric Richmond a senior adviser to Biden and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement  Richmond speaking on MSNBC on Tuesday morning said The regular sentiment of hearts and prayers are not enough  We need action on this in the country he said pointing to recently passed legislation in the House This President has a track record of fighting against the NRA and beating them and we need to make sure that we have sensible gun regulations in this country to ensure safety And so we need action not just words and prayers  Among the executive actions Biden could advance include requiring background checks on ghost guns that dont have serial numbers or strengthening the federal background check system to alert law enforcement agencies when someone fails a check Biden has also said he will task the attorney general with better enforcement of existing gun laws And advocates have raised the idea of sending more federal money to communities afflicted by gun violence  But some advocates walked away from meetings at the White House without a clear picture of the timeline for unveiling any gun control steps or a legislative plan for advancing gun control measures in an evenly split Congress It wasnt clear from the meetings whether Biden would support doing away with the filibuster for gun control legislation  During his private meeting with Asian community leaders in Atlanta last week the issue of gun control did arise briefly when one of the participants spoke about a background check bill that was being introduced in the Georgia Legislature according to a person familiar with the meeting Biden voiced his support for expanding background checks but did not offer a timeline and later during public remarks at Emory University made no mention of gun control  Uphill fight  Ultimately gun control issues  which face an uphill battle for passage in a Senate narrowly controlled by Democrats  are further down on Bidens list of legislative priorities than issues such as infrastructure and immigration  As a candidate Biden said on his first day in office he would send a bill to Congress repealing liability protection for gun manufacturers and close background check loopholes actions he has yet to take seven weeks into office  It remains a commitment a personal commitment of the Presidents to do more on gun safety to put more measures in place to use the power of the presidency to work with Congress And certainly theres an important role for the attorney general and the Justice Department to play in this regard White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last Thursday Unfortunately dont have any updates for you today but it is an issue he remains committed to  The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing Tuesday on the future of gun control in the Senate Two Housepassed bills tackled who can buy a gun and how to close loopholes on background checks but the votes are not there in the 5050 Senate to pass the House bills or an assault weapons ban or a limit on magazines Despite this Schumer has pledged to bring the Houses universal background check bill to the floor  The sticking point between Republicans and Democrats on background checks is on if there should be exceptions and if so who they should apply to Most lawmakers agree that if you are going to go and buy a gun from a licensed firearm dealer or at a gun show you should have a background check What they dont agree on is whether when you sell a gun to a family member or friend or privately transfer a gun do you have to run a background check  Thats why the 2013 bipartisan deal struck by Sens Joe Manchin DWest Virginia and Pat Toomey RPennsylvania was a significant agreement It struck a compromise and would have required background checks on all commercial sales of guns But it failed in 2013 and is not the legislation that Democrats are currently looking at bringing up for a vote', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer Friday as he sought to take House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage Patrick ColsonPrice   David DePape 42 faces decades in prison if convicted  DePape allegedly roused Paul Pelosi 82 from his sleep after breaking into the San Francisco home  The suspect said he chose not to flee after Paul Pelosi called 911  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time of the attack  A 42yearold man who allegedly targeted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a breakin at her San Francisco home was charged Monday with a raft of charges by state and federal authorities including attempted murder assault and attempted kidnapping in connection with the violent attack on her husband telling police he intended to hold the speaker hostage  In announcing the charges against David DePape the Justice Department said the suspect told police after assaulting Paul Pelosi with a hammer that he had been looking for the speaker and had planned to break her kneecaps if she failed to respond to his questions truthfully  In the course of the interview DePape articulated he viewed Nancy as the leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic Party the federal affidavit states DePape also later explained that by breaking Nancys kneecaps she would then have to be wheeled into Congress which would show other Members of Congress there were consequences to actions  Paul Pelosi attack The latest on his recovery what people are saying David DePapes charges  Federal authorities charged DePape with one count of assault of an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to retaliate against the official which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison He also is accused of one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties punishable by a maximum 20year sentence  San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins followed the federal announcement unveiling charges of attempted murder elderly abuse threats to a public official and other local charges  It appears as though this was politically motivated Jenkins said at an evening briefing in San Francisco  The federal affidavit describes the bizarre conduct of the suspect who broke into the house through a glass door and confronted Pelosi in an upstairs bedroom  DePape carrying a backpack containing a tape rope a second hammer gloves and zip ties allegedly roused Pelosi from sleep saying he was looking for Nancy  When Pelosi told him the speaker was not at home the suspect allegedly removed the zip ties stating that he intended to restrain Pelosi so that DePape could go to sleep because he was tired from carrying the backpack to the home  Pelosi according to court documents engaged the suspect in conversation before moving to a bathroom where he grabbed a phone and called 911  More San Francisco DA Dispatchers handling of Paul Pelosis 911 call may have saved his life  DePape allegedly told police that he was aware that Pelosi had called police but elected not to flee because he was fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender  The two later went downstairs where Pelosi opened the door when police arrived and grabbed the hammer held by DePape  Police ordered DePape to drop the hammer but the suspect told police that he did not plan to surrender and then struck Pelosi  DePape explained that Pelosis actions resulted in Pelosi taking the punishment instead the affidavit stated  During a Saturday search of the Richmond California garage where DePape had been living for two years police recovered two hammers a sword and a pair of rubber and cloth gloves  More Heartbroken and traumatized Nancy Pelosi shares first comments since attack on her husband Paul Pelosi  The stunning attack coming just more than week before the midterm elections underscored a recent surge in threats against public officials in an increasingly divisive political environment  On the day of the Pelosi assault federal authorities issued the governments strongest warning yet of the heightened threat to the midterm elections posed by violent extremists  The most plausible DVE domestic violent extremist threat is posed by lone offenders who leverage electionrelated issues to justify violence according to the fivepage bulletin issued by Department of Homeland Security FBI National Counterterrorism Center and US Capitol Police Enduring perceptions of election fraud related to the 2020 general election continue to contribute to the radicalization of some DVEs and likely would increase their sensitivity to any new claims perceived as reaffirming their belief that US elections are corrupt  The multiagency response to the Pelosi attack involving the FBI and Capitol Police along with local San Francisco authorities highlighted the deep concern for public officials and their families  We assess that electionrelated perceptions of fraud and DVE reactions to divisive topics will likely drive sporadic DVE plotting of violence and broader efforts to justify violence in the lead up to and following the 2022 midterm election cycle the bulletin stated Some DVEs continue to amplify narratives related to the perception of fraud in the 2020 general election and varied perceptions of divisive topics linked to the midterms to justify calls for violence',

Authorities have recovered some 300 classified documents from Trumps Florida home over the course of this year including 100 seized during the August search  Trump doubled down on his claim he declassified the records in a Wednesday night interview with Fox Newss Sean Hannity  I did declassify he said If youre the president of the United States you can declassify just by saying Its declassified Even by thinking about it  He also implied there would be no evidence of such a decision even though a presidential declassification triggers a number of actions from various intelligence agencies  There can be a process but there doesnt have to be Youre the president You make that decision So when you send it its declassified Trump added  In court however  where Trumps lawyers have insinuated he may have declassified the documents but stopped short of fully making the assertion  judges this week pushed back  A Florida judge initially looked more positively to that argument and others granting Trumps request for a special master but subsequent judges havent responded as favorably  Trumps legal team resisted a request from Judge Raymond Dearie the candidate they forwarded to be special master who is now serving in the role to elaborate on a filing noting that Trump could have declassified the records Their failure to do so seemed to irk the judge when both parties met with Dearie on Tuesday  And an appeals court on Wednesday ruled in favor of the Justice Department striking down a lower courts denial of their request to exempt the classified records from the special master process  Trumps declassification claims featured in the ruling  Plaintiff suggests that he may have declassified these documents when he was President But the record contains no evidence that any of these records were declassified And before the special master Plaintiff resisted providing any evidence that he had declassified any of these documents a threejudge panel that included two Trump appointees ruled for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals  Declassification would not excuse the crimes listed on the warrant to search Trumps home The Espionage Act deals only with national defense information while another deals with concealing government records  The court also questioned why the Trump team was making the claim noting that regardless he has no reason to claim declassified records are his personal property  In any event at least for these purposes the declassification argument is a red herring because declassifying an official document would not change its content or render it personal So even if we assumed that plaintiff did declassify some or all of the documents that would not explain why he has a personal interest in them the judges wrote  For our part we cannot discern why plaintiff would have an individual interest in or need for any of the onehundred documents with classification markings  The tranche of documents found at Trumps home include some of the nations most closely guarded secrets including those that can only be accessed by those with a need to know  This requirement pertains equally to former presidents unless the current administration in its discretion chooses to waive that requirement the court wrote  In their first conference with Dearie the special master the Trump team balked at a request to explain the declassification claim arguing they should only have to do so if criminal charges are filed and they file a Rule 41g that allows for recovery of seized property  James Trusty an attorney for Trump said they were not in a position to explain further  We have the concerns that weve already talked about basically about declassification defense and when and how that should be borne out if its going to be meaning that we shouldnt be in a position to have to disclose declarations witness statements whatever it might be to substantiate that until a Rule 41g is filed Trusty said  Well you did bring the lawsuit and make that claim Dearie responded  What weve done is weve raised the issue We have not been in a position nor should we be at this juncture to fully disclose a substantive defense relating to declassification until we see the documents Trusty said  But Dearie did not appear satisfied by that answer adding later You cant have your cake and eat it  Whether Trump declassified the documents is no longer at issue in the special master review  the 11th Circuit granted DOJs request to exempt the classified records from the review so it could continue its national security and criminal investigation connected to the documents  But another one of Trumps claims has also been pulled into the special masters review  In a plan for reviewing the more than 10000 documents taken at the property Dearie asked Trumps team to account for the former presidents claims that the FBI may have planted evidence  Trump made the insinuation just two days after his home was searched  Everyone was asked to leave the premises they wanted to be alone he wrote in a post on his social media platform without any witnesses to see what they were doing taking or hopefully not planting  Trump again made the assertion during his Fox interview this week  The problem that you have is they go into rooms  they wont let anybody near  they wouldnt even let them in the same building Did they drop anything on those piles Or did they do it later he said  Dearies plan asks Trumps team for a declaration with a list of any specific items set forth in the FBIs detailed property inventory that plaintiff asserts were not seized from the premises', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

hundreds of millions and last month prompted the biggest show of public discontent in mainland China since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012  Although last months protests largely subsided amid a heavy police presence across major cities regional authorities have since cut back on lockdowns quarantine rules and testing requirements to varying degrees Top officials have also softened their

a new set of nationwide rules is due to be announced soon two sources with knowledge of the matter told  paving the way for more coordinated easing  Beijing is also weighing whether to scale down its

schoolmates and two teachers were killed Now Zayon whos supposed to start third grade Tuesday doesnt want to set foot in another classroom his father said  I went and talked to my son and I told him Theyre gonna have more cops Theyre gonna have higher fencing And he wasnt having it said Zayons father Adam Martinez  He said It doesnt matter Theyre not gonna protect us  Zayon Martinez 8 hid from the gunfire at Robb Elementary His dad says hes too traumatized to go back in a classroom Ashley Killough  Zayons fear is not unfounded Since the tragic end to the last school year the grief enveloping Uvalde Texas has been compounded by outrage  Families learned law enforcement officers waited more than 70 minutes before entering the two classrooms where 19 students and two teachers lay mortally wounded  And authorities repeatedly changed their stories about what happened as damning new evidence emerged  Now families who already lost one child in the massacre worry about sending another child back to school And months of preparation by parents and school administrators will be put to the test  Robb Elementary School will not reopen  No students or staff will return to the site of the deadliest school massacre in almost a decade  Were not going back to that campus Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Superintendent Hal Harrell said in June  Instead children who were first graders at Robb Elementary last year will start second grade at Dalton Elementary  Second and third graders at Robb last year will go to the new Uvalde Elementary located at an existing educational complex in town Many Robb Elementary teachers have relocated to Uvalde Elementary  And some students have left the school district entirely  Enrollment at Sacred Heart Catholic School in Uvalde began its new school year with double the enrollment of elementaryage students compared to last fall its principal said The new students include 30 from Robb Elementary who received scholarships to go to the private school  All students remaining in the Uvalde public school district could sign up for remote learning and use tablets provided by the school district  APGetty Images  Martinez said both his children opted for remote learning I talked to my son and daughter and they said that they were afraid that if it happened again they werent going to be protected he said  Theres no fencing at the junior high where my daughter would be going Theres no way that Im gonna convince her to go when theres no fencing  But remote learning isnt possible for some families in which both parents work outside the home  And changing the scenery wont erase the horror tormenting victims families  especially those debating whether to send their other children back to school  I dont feel like my kids are safe  Uziyah Garcia should be starting the fifth grade today But he was gunned down in his classroom at age 10 leaving his family crippled with grief  This is something that terrorizes you daily and nightly said Uziyahs uncle Brett Cross who was raising Uziyah like his own son  I close my eyes All I see is my son I hear the gunshots It is something that doesnt ever go away  But Cross has four other children in the school district Hes struggled to decide whether to send them back to school in person  You want your kids to be able to go and have that education and everything but at the same time youre fearful that theyre not gonna make it out by the end of the day he said  Cross spent much of this summer demanding accountability from the school district and lambasting the law enforcement response  Weve already seen that they didnt do their job So how are we supposed to trust that he said last week I dont feel like my kids are safe  Brett Cross shows his tattoo honoring his slain nephew Uziyah Garcia whom he was raising as his own son Ashley Killough  Cross has two 15yearold daughters who have decided to return to school in person He said theyre old enough to make their own decisions with their parents guidance  But my little ones ages 7 and 10  were not certain yet he said I dont feel like everything has been done to protect our children  A

Next  Cross said he appreciated some changes made by the school district After the district announced 33 Texas Department of Public Safety officers would work at Uvalde schools this year Cross said he was assured those DPS officers would not be among the dozens who responded the day of the massacre  But he wants to see more active monitoring of schools Weve had several requests about somebody  watching the surveillance and everything like that a dedicated person he said That would make me feel a lot safer  What the school district is doing  After months of public outcry the Uvalde school district fired its police chief Pedro Pete Arredondo State investigators and law enforcement analysts say Arredondo was the de facto incident commander the day of the massacre  A memorial outside Robb Elementary School in June honored the 19 children and two teachers gunned down on May 24 Brandon BellGetty Images  The Uvalde school district also announced new safety measures planned for this school year They include hiring 10 more school police officers installing 500 new security cameras the assignment of 33 Texas DPS officers to the Uvalde school district and searching for a new interim police chief  The school district said it has also increased emotional support for students including comfort dogs on every campus for the first few weeks of school additional school counselors and traumainformed care training for all staff members  But Cross said hes not done demanding more safety measures  not just for his surviving children but for all children in hopes no other family has to endure the agony hes suffering  Im fighting the system that let him Uziyah down Im at every city council meeting Im at every school board meeting he said  Cross has also questioned why 18yearolds in Texas can buy assaultstyle rifles like the one used to kill Uziyah  You have to be 21 to buy cigarettes and alcohol  things that can kill yourself But you only have to be 18 to buy something that can kill multiple people he said  Im channeling my grief into the fight right now because this fight is a fight that everybody should be a part of  but nobody is until its them And its a lot harder on this side with this hole in your heart to do this fight', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

       " {'guid': 1914, 'text_a': 'If Georgia Democratic Sen Raphael Warnock wants to win next months Senate runoff election he should lean into climate policy exit polling suggests  In his first matchup against Republican Herschel Walkerin which neither candidate cracked 50 percent leading to the Dec 6 runoffWarnock attracted significant support from young people the voting bloc most likely to be concerned about climate change  Thats according to postelection research from Tufts University And its part of a national trend that shows voters younger than 30 helped turn the tide for Democrats in key swing states and blunt an expected Republican wave in the midterm elections  Youth are increasing their electoral participation leading movements and making their voices heard on key issues that affect their communities according to analysis from Tufts Universitys Center for Information  Research on Civic Learning and Engagement  Overall 27 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 turned out for the midterms the secondhighest percentage on record according to the Tufts University data But that number rose to 31 percent in key swing states including Florida Michigan North Carolina New Hampshire Nevada Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsinand Georgia  Warnock won 494 percent of the overall vote in this months midterm elections compared to 485 percent for Walker Georgia election rules require a runoff if no candidate breaks the 50 percent threshold  Young Georgians accounted for 116000 votes of Warnocks total share according to Tufts Thats almost three times the margin of his edge over Walker  In Georgia young voters were about 13 percent of the electorate higher than any other swing state won by Democrats Tufts found They voted for Warnock over Walker by about 2 to 1  Young people are more likely than any other voting bloc to be concerned about climate policy polling has long shown  To move any young person out of their apartment and into the voting booth the candidate has to be relying on issues related to climate change I think its just kind of table stakes said John Della Volpe director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and author of Fight How Gen Z is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America  The Tufts analysis found that more than 8 in 10 young midterm voters said climate was a very serious or somewhat serious issue  In Georgia young votersespecially voters of colorare highly motivated by climate policy said Sara Suzuki a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts who helped analyze the results  Not running on climate more seriously is a missed opportunity she said Communities of color are feeling climate issues more acutely and that helps explain why young people of color are really prioritizing climate as an issue  In the Georgia Senate race the two candidates are on the opposite ends of the climate policy spectrum  Climate and clean energy policy already is proving to be a jobs creator Last month Hyundai opened a 55 billion electricvehicle and battery plant in Georgia that will create 8000 jobs Georgia is also ranked seventh in the country for solar installation according to the Solar Energy Industries Association  Warnock attended the groundbreaking for the plant in Savannah alongside Republican Gov Brian Kemp He told reporters that climate policy is a moral issue and then touted his green credentials  Ive also put forward a lot of legislation focused on creating a green energy future everything from electric vehicles to electric batteries being manufactured in the state to investing in solar manufacturing he said  By contrast Walker said last week that the United States isnt ready for more renewable energy  Were not prepared were not ready right now he said What we need to do is keep having those gasguzzling cars We got the good emissions under those cars  It will take another few weeks before more comprehensive exit polling data is finished but the early midterm results show climate was a motivating factor for many voters  The Associated Press VoteCast found that inflation and the economy dominated voter concernsand that about half of voters said it was their top concern No other issue came close but about 10 percent of voters listed other issues as their top concern including climate abortion health care and gun policy  Young voters had the secondhighest rate of voting in any midterm second only to the 2018 midterms during former President Donald Trumps term  In fact Generation Z and millennial voters under 30 voted in such a large number that they canceled out every voter 65 and older according to Della Volpe who has overseen Harvards youth polling since 2000 That effectively decided the fate of the election because young people overwhelmingly voted in favor of Democrats at 63 percent with 35 percent voting for Republicans he found  Millennials and members of the Z generation have now delivered three elections in a row for Democrats he said By 2024 they will account for nearly 40 percent of votes Della Volpe noted  Young voters want to support candidates who share their values and who acknowledge that climate change presents significant challenges to their generation If a candidates position does not align with climate science does not align with a young persons perspective Im not sure there is anything that candidate can do to win that voters support Its essential Della Volpe said  There was evidence of the power of the youth vote in races across the country particularly in the closest races  In the Arizona governors race Democrat Katie Hobbs eked out a narrow victory of about 20000 votes over Republican Kari Lake Young voters accounted for about 60000 votes in the state according to Tufts estimates  In Nevada Democratic Sen Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection over Republican Adam Laxalt securing Democratic control of the Senate by 9000 votes Young people accounted for a net 28000 votes Tufts found  In Pennsylvania and Arizona young voters overwhelmingly voted for the Democrats Pennsylvania Lt Gov John Fetterman D received 70 percent of their vote compared to Republican Mehmet Ozs 28 percent In Arizona incumbent Democratic Sen Mark Kelly received 76 percent of the young vote compared to the 20 percent received by Republican Blake Masters  For a long time young voters have been counted out said Jack Lobel deputy communications director for Voters of Tomorrow a youth voting organization But Democrats have made tangible progress on a number of their issues in the last two years he said Passing a major climate bill and working to protect abortion rights while addressing student loan debt motivated young people to go vote  Clearly the will of young voters was to elect people who are thinking about our future and I think thats especially apparent on issues of climate change he said President Biden definitely moved the needle with voters on the Inflation Reduction Act Its a symbol

hearing at the Statehouse in Indianapolis July 26 2022 The debate over a limited set of circumstances in which abortion could be legal is causing divisions among GOP lawmakers in some states  Danger of overreach  In the midterms President Joe Biden campaigned on abortion rights calling on Congress to codify Roe But that effort is stalled leaving abortion access to the states for the foreseeable future In a tacit acknowledgment of that reality the Biden administration has pledged to ensure that women who want or need to travel across state lines to access the procedure will not be impeded  In the new divided Congress both parties may try to pass bills with no chance of becoming law just to make a point But theres a danger of overreach  on both sides  There will probably be an effort to pass some kind of national abortion ban which is the very definition of outside the mainstream if it includes no exceptions for rape or incest says Republican pollster Whit Ayres  Republicans won control of the House because voters want them to do something about inflation crime and border security Mr Ayres says  not to ban all abortions or cut off aid to Ukraine or conduct endless investigations into the Biden administration  GOP politicians who support abortion rights  a small universe represented most prominently by Sens Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine  say Democratic legislation advertised as codifying Roe in fact goes further and thus cant win broad support Bipartisan legislation in the Senate known as the Reproductive Freedom for All Act has gone nowhere  Democratic strategists are also looking ahead Pollster Celinda Lake predicts more statewide initiatives to enshrine abortion rights and other ways to drive the message home  both broadly and to targeted demographics  In the 2022 midterms more than 428 million was spent on abortionrelated advertising the vast majority by Democrats according to the adtracking firm AdImpact  More than 40 of all Democratic advertising was on the abortion issue Ms Lake notes predicting youll see more of that going forward I think that there is now a recognition that the youth vote is our best vote she adds Abortion and birth control can play a major role in energizing young voters which will be important for us in 2024  Beyond ads abortionrights advocacy groups also tout the volunteer doorknocking phone and text banking and mail efforts that they say were vital to Democratic victories in key states including Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Those three states were the blue wall that Mr Trump breached on his way to victory in 2016 and which Mr Biden won back in 2020  In Michigan Democratic Gov Gretchen Whitmer made abortion her No 1 issue and won reelection easily Her party also took control of the state legislature setting up total Democratic control of Michigan state government for the first time in nearly 40 years The abortionrights ballot measure spurred turnout helping Democratic candidates Professor Grossmann says  Likewise in Wisconsin the reelection of Democratic Gov Tony Evers and Republicans failure to win a vetoproof majority in the lower legislative chamber represent a victory for abortion rights  Eddie MooreThe Albuquerque JournalAP Vice President Kamala Harris right along with New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham left and Eve Espey chairwoman of the University of New Mexico Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology talk about states where abortion rights are protected during a conversation on reproductive rights in Albuquerque New Mexico Oct 25 2022  Vice President Kamala Harris can also be counted among the midterm winners After the Supreme Court ruling leaked in May she held more than 35 events with abortionrights advocates around the country helping to rally the Democratic base Vice President Harris was seen by some as an especially effective voice on the issue as women of color are disproportionately affected by the demise of Roe  Professor Grossmann inserts a note of caution He agrees that the high courts landmark ruling in Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization which overturned Roe gave Democrats a burst of energy But over the course of the campaign he notes polls showed the issue fading with suburban women shifting back toward Republicans over the economy and crime  If the elections had been held in August Democrats probably would have done even better Professor Grossmann says  The next cycle  Certainly by 2024 the issue landscape will have evolved The state of the economy matters more in presidential races than in midterms and if high inflation and other economic challenges persist when voters go to the polls the Democrats could face stiffer headwinds  Some antiabortion Republicans are also working to improve the public image of their sides advocacy efforts Melissa Hart a former member of Congress from the Pittsburgh area just joined the board of an organization called Vision for Life which advertises the services of pregnancy care centers Liberals often vilify such centers saying they deceive women in crisis pregnancies to steer them away from abortion  People decry prolifers and say they dont care about the baby when shes born Ms Hart says Pregnancy care centers do everything  medical care clothing diapers finding housing A lot of people dont know about that  News organizations are already starting to publish stories reflecting the reallife impact of the Dobbs ruling and more are certain to follow These could feature women in restrictive states trying to obtain an abortion women who encounter roadblocks and end up having the baby doctors navigating risky legal terrain All could further influence the national debate  Presidential candidates will also be pressed to take a clear stand on the issue Mr Trump who has already declared his candidacy now has Roes demise as part of his legacy as he nominated the Supreme Court justices who provided the pivotal votes But so far he has not been trumpeting his role in overturning a nationwide right to abortion  Floridas GOP governor Ron DeSantis has also kept relatively quiet on abortion Hes fresh off a landslide reelection and polls show is the top potential primary opponent to Mr Trump yet the issue could be tricky for him Florida already limits abortion to 15 weeks gestation with no exception for

believing this to be true and 78 of Democrats agreeing  On July 5 a Monmouth poll reported that President Joe Bidens approval rating had sunk to 36 with 59 disapproving of his presidency  As for our Democraticled Congress 15 of all Americans approved of its performance with 85 disapproving  Another Gallup survey from July 5 reported that this last year has seen a fall in public confidence in every one of 16 major US institutions  The institutions in which Americans now place the least confidence are the presidency newspapers the criminal justice system big business television news and at rock bottom Congress Only 7 of Americans have great confidence or quite a bit of confidence in Capitol Hill  The institutions that enjoy the greatest measures of confidence  though here too the levels are receding like Lake Mead  are small business the military the police the medical system and religious institutions  That small business is the most trusted of American institutions suggests that Bidens attack on the alleged greed of gas station owners may not be politically wise  American institutions that tend to be conservative  small business the military cops  are where the American people repose the greatest confidence Journalistic institutions  newspapers and TV news  both largely liberal appear to be ones in which the nation reposes the lowest levels of confidence and the greatest deposits of distrust  Why are Americans so down on their country and disapproving of its direction and of their president who is leading them  Surely the pandemic which has taken a million lives in 30 months and infects 10 times as many of us today as it did a year ago with the death toll roughly the same now as then is a primary cause  The crisis at the Mexican border where a quarter of a million illegal migrants enter our country uninvited every month with cartel mules ferrying the fentanyl and other narcotics that kill tens of thousands of young Americans every year is surely another  Then there is the worst inflation in 40 years and the record rise in the price of food and fuel for Americas families  Also since the first of the year there have been an average of 10 mass

       " {'guid': 2336, 'text_a': '   Political leaders are generally at their strongest the moment they take office  Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is far from assured of winning sufficient support in his party to become House speaker next month But even before the vote his authority is already weakening by the day  in a way that could make him a speaker who is in office but not in power  The tiny GOP House majority that takes over in January after a disappointing midterm performance would mean a fragile governing mandate for any party at any point in American history And the ideological struggle being waged by proDonald Trump extremists inside the party would have made even a more comfortable majority volatile  But the compromises that McCarthy is facing in his increasingly bitter campaign for the speakership threaten to leave him as a tool of the most radical members of his conference and could diminish his capacity to hold the job in the long term  The California Republican is fighting a rearguard battle against members who want to make it easier to eject a sitting speaker and hes appeasing exPresident Donald Trumps extremism and that of acolytes like Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene to save a narrow political power base propping up his dream of running the House  Once an avuncular and smoothtalking GOP rising star McCarthy has adopted some of the confrontational defiance of the Make America Great Again movement seeming to seek out soundbite clashes with the press as badges of honor  Given that he can only afford to lose four votes to be elected speaker  and then to pass legislation  it would take a political genius to corral the GOP conference While McCarthy is broadly popular among Republican lawmakers and is a prodigious fundraiser nothing so far in his career suggests he is a leader of that caliber In fact he seems less of a heavyweight than former GOP Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan who were driven out of politics by the impossibility of running a riotous Republican majority  If politics is the art of the possible McCarthy is acting in a way that is most likely to allow him to reach power  even if the speakers gavel might turn into a poisoned chalice and require him to infringe democratic values to keep it  But his struggle to lock in the speakership and his possible futile future mission of amassing a governing majority amount to more than an insideWashington brouhaha or internal GOP feud If the House cannot pass spending bills or if radical members of the Republican conference try to hold McCarthy hostage the economic and social consequences could soon affect tens of millions of Americans Government shutdowns budget showdowns and an impasse over raising US borrowing limits could severely damage the US economy the militarys readiness and the dollars reputation as a reserve currency  This is one reason why the current yearend tussle over whether to fund the government for a full year  a bipartisan framework agreement for which was announced Tuesday night  or for just a few months is so critical since it could dump a fiscal crisis on the lap of a weak and easily manipulated new speaker next month  McCarthys impossible math  From a broader political perspective it might be in McCarthys interest to stand up to the most extreme members of his conference The path to the GOP majority went through comparatively moderate seats in places like New York that will be most at risk in the 2024 election And proTrump electiondenying extremists like those who are tormenting him now were mostly rejected by swingstate voters in the midterm elections The antiTrump vote was also decisive in the 2018 election when Republicans lost the House and in 2020 when they lost the presidency  So showing voters in 2024 that GOP governance addressed key problems like inflation and the economy will be important But while he has announced he will form a select committee to examine Chinas growing threat which could unite both parties most of McCarthys recent rhetoric has focused on a relentless set of investigations of the Biden administration and conservatives interest in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas  The GOP leaders attitude is easily explained The nature of the House with its twoyear terms and gerrymandered districts means McCarthys lawmakers are easily radicalized with the greatest threat to their jobs often coming from more extreme opponents in primaries And while he is clearly catering to the most zealous members of his conference the House GOP as a whole is extremely conservative Two years ago a majority of Republican lawmakers including McCarthy voted against certifying Joe Bidens election win despite the absence of any credible claims of fraud and after the desecration of Congress by Trumps mob  The steps McCarthy is taking to try to secure the speakership  and the future complications that may entail  were evident on Tuesday when he gave Greene the Georgia Republican a pass for her latest effort to mock the trauma of the Capitol insurrection The congresswoman had said over the weekend that had she been in charge on January 6 2021 the riot would have succeeded and the mob would have been armed She later insisted she was being sarcastic after the White House complained her comments were a slap in the face to law enforcement and against fundamental US values  Asked by s Manu Raju on Tuesday about Greenes latest inflammatory comments McCarthy shrugged them off Oh I think she said she was being facetious the possible future speaker answered His attitude was not a surprise it was consistent with his attempts to rewrite the history of the worst attack on US democracy in modern times for which he briefly said Trump bore responsibility  But it also reflected Greenes growing personal power after she broke with some radical GOP members and lined up to support McCarthys speakership After coming to Congress as a fringe figure and quickly losing her committee assignments over her past retweets of violent rhetoric against Democrats Greene now promises to be one of the most prominent faces of the new GOP majority That she has the latitude to make what to many people are offensive and insurrectionist comments without any fear of rebuke from her partys leader says a lot about her position And it also shows that while Trumps power may be waning elsewhere after a lackluster launch of his 2024 campaign his influence over his followers in the House like Greene remains strong  The same dynamic was at play when McCarthy declined to directly criticize the expresident for meeting with white supremacist Nick Fuentes at a dinner also featuring Kanye West the rapper now known as Ye who has recently made a string of antisemitic remarks In a histrionic performance at the White House after meeting Biden and other congressional leaders last month the House Republican leader falsely claimed that Trump had condemned Fuentes four times when he hadnt done so once  How the current spending fight is being shaped by McCarthys speaker bid  McCarthys hardening opposition towards a yearend spending bill in the lame duck Congress also shows that he understands that without indulging his most ideological colleagues he may never become speaker  s Raju and Melanie Zanona reported Tuesday that McCarthy had signaled at the White House meeting that hed be open to a large bill But while Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell worked on such a measure Tuesday and declared it broadly appealing McCarthy told his members that he was a Hell no on the measure  The split not only augurs likely future tensions between Republicans in the House and McConnell it raises the possibility that it will become politically more difficult for some Republican senators to vote for a spending deal now  especially as conservative media has taken up McCarthys line  A shortterm fix that takes the issue into early next year could provoke a gargantuan showdown with the White House in the first days of GOP control of the House with members firmly committed to slashing Bidens spending plans and domestic agenda Even though that would be a high risk for McCarthy that could backfire with a national electorate setting up the possibility of such a confrontation might be one way to shore up his vote in the speakership campaign  Still given that Democrats should be able to pass a broader funding deal in the final days of their majority McCarthys opposition could win him points with no longterm consequence  a potentially

oversee the criminal investigation into Trumps retention of government documents after he left office Trump defended himself with dishonesty  repeating his false and thoroughly debunked claims about how other expresidents handled official records  Trump speaking Friday night at a gala at his MaraLago resort and residence asked why there is not an investigation into all of the other presidents that preceded me including but not limited to Republicans George HW Bush and George W Bush He claimed that these previous presidents kept documents and he continued In one case they had it in a Chinese restaurant with broken windows And in another case they had a Chinese restaurant connected to a bowling alley This is where the documents were kept They took documents with them President Obama took documents  Video Ad Feedback Merrick Garland announces special counsel to oversee Trump investigations 0711  Source CNN  Facts First Trumps claims are again false  and they have been debunked by the National Archives and Records Administration NARA itself As NARA explained in an August statement Barack Obama did not take the presidential documents Trump claimed Obama had taken Rather NARA itself moved documents from the Obama administration to a NARAmanaged facility in the Chicago area near where Obamas presidential library is being built NARA similarly explained in a statement in October after Trump added other past presidents to the baseless narrative that neither of the Bushes took the documents Trump claimed they had taken Again it was NARA that took the Bushes presidential documents to facilities that NARA managed near the future locations of their presidential libraries  In other words there is no equivalence between Trumps situation  in which he allegedly took hundreds of classified documents plus numerous other presidential records to the MaraLago resort and residence  and the situations or really nonsituations of his predecessors  Trump used the Friday speech to deliver a variety of other criticism of Garlands decision to appoint the special counsel veteran prosecutor Jack Smith Smith will also oversee a second criminal investigation that involves Trump that one into whether anybody unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election or with the congressional certification of Joe Bidens victory in the Electoral College on or about January 6 2021 Smith wont oversee the investigations or prosecutions of people who physically breached the Capitol that day  Trumps claim about a bowling alley and restaurant  Trumps suggestion that past presidents documents were stored in an insecure manner is also false  The facility where George HW Bushs presidential documents were temporarily stored in College Station Texas was indeed a former bowling alley connected to a former Chinese restaurant But by the time Bushs records arrived the building had been turned by NARA into a professional archiving facility with extensive security measures and no more bowling lanes or equipment  Though Trump has repeatedly claimed or suggested that the College Station facility was not secure  this time he said it had broken windows  this narrative is baseless too In its October statement NARA said that all of the temporary facilities where it stored past presidents documents met strict archival and security standards NARA said that reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives after they left office or that the records were housed in substandard conditions are false and misleading  You dont have to take NARAs recent word for it The Associated Press reported in 1994 Uniformed guards patrol the premises There are closedcircuit television monitors and sophisticated electronic detectors along walls and doors Some printed material is classified and will remain so for years it is open only to those with topsecret clearances  Finally it is not a revelation that the facility had a colorful past as a restaurant and alley NARA officials publicly joked about this at the time Its normal for NARA to lease large buildings that formerly had some other purpose The Washington Post reported in 1993 There arent any lanes anymore No gutters no pins no beer Thanks to a rush remodeling job after last Novembers election there are a few simple offices a massive fireresistant vault and row after row of steel shelves filled with cardboard boxes and wooden crates  Trump has continued making these false claims about his predecessors not only despite the NARA statements debunking them but despite numerous factchecks from major media outlets He also made the claim about Obama supposedly taking documents in

from multiple probes that are expected to ramp up now that investigators selfimposed hiatus on overt activity ahead of the midterms has been replaced with pressure to file any charges well in advance of the 2024 election  The first indictment of a former president would not bar Trump from running for reelection But such a historic move would almost certainly destabilize the country and deepen emerging divisions within the Republican Party as primary election season draws nearer  Heres where three investigations surrounding Trump currently stand  DOJ probe of classified document handling Pace expected to intensify  Pages from a DOJ court filing on Aug 30 2022 in response to a request from the legal team of former President Donald Trump for a special master to review the documents seized during the Aug 8 search of MaraLago are photographed on Aug 31 2022 Included in the filing was a FBI photo of documents that were seized during the search  The Department of Justice DOJ probe into Trumps potentially unlawful retention of classified records after leaving the White House could soon ramp up significantly  Some legal experts believe that based on whats publicly known there is enough evidence to pursue charges against Trump for mishandling national defense information The recent addition of two highprofile veteran prosecutors to the investigative team could also indicate an uptick in tempo  What began with the National Archives asking Trump last year to return all presidential records has since spiraled into a tense legal standoff In January Trump returned 15 boxes of records which were later discovered to contain around 100 classified documents including highly sensitive materials  The FBI later concluded that more classified records remained at the former presidents Florida home and obtained a warrant to search MaraLago Investigators seized some 11000 additional documents which included more than 100 records marked as classified  Both Trump and top aide Kash Patel have said publicly that the former president declassified the records housed at MaraLago though Trumps lawyers have stopped short of making this assertion in court filings  Patel has reportedly faced questioning at least twice before a grand jury investigating Trumps possible mishandling of classified documents According to reports Patel initially asserted his Fifth Amendment right against selfincrimination before prosecutors granted Patel limited immunity to shield him from liability for anything said before the grand jury  Meanwhile the case has become bogged down in legal skirmishing In August a Trumpappointed judge in Florida granted the former presidents request to subject the documents seized at MaraLago to further judicial scrutiny  Judge Aileen Cannon agreed to appoint a thirdparty monitor to the case known as special master who is charged with reviewing the records The special master Judge Raymond Dearie will make a recommendation to Cannon over whether the records at issue belong to Trump or the government and if any are subject to executive or attorneyclient privilege  The Department of Justice for its part has urged the court to broadly reject Trumps sweeping claims regarding his possession of the records and their privileged status The department has also appealed the appointment of a special master with a hearing in the case scheduled for Tuesday  In addition to the obvious political sensitivities surrounding the decision over whether to charge Trump other rare challenges exist too  The highly sensitive nature of the records at issue  including classified materials that reportedly relate to Irans missile system and China  means the DOJ would have to get the intelligence communitys permission to use those records in their prosecution of Trump  To use classified documents in a criminal case the originator of the material would need to sign off Usually that means declassification said Barbara McQuade a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of Michigan Law School  If these documents are as sensitive as they have been reported to be then members of the intelligence community will not approve their use It may be that an eventual trial includes only a subset of the classified documents she added For criminal cases prosecutors look for what they refer to as Goldilocks documents those that are neither too sensitive nor too insignificant  DOJ investigation of Jan 6 attack Scope has extended to Trumps orbit  Violent insurrectionists storm the Capitol on Jan 6 2021 in Washington  The DOJ is also probing Trumps actions surrounding the Jan 6 2021 attack at the Capitol though this investigation has been largely overshadowed by the Trump classified records case  The Jan 6 investigation has steadily expanded over the nearly two years since the attack In addition to charging some 950 people with crimes related to the Jan 6 riot the departments probe now extends to members of Trumps orbit and the former presidents own actions  though there is no public evidence that Trump is currently the subject of a criminal investigation on this front  The grand jury investigating Jan 6 has approved subpoenas for information on any coordination between Trump his lawyers senior officials and others in his orbit who helped to operationalize the Trumps lies about his 2020 electoral defeat in a bid block the transfer of power to then Presidentelect Joe Biden  According to The Washington Post which first reported in July that Trumps actions figured into the DOJs investigation prosecutors have asked witnesses about postelection meetings involving Trump the phony proTrump electors scheme and pressure on thenVice President Mike Pence to overturn Bidens victory  This summer before the probe went quiet in September due to the approaching Nov 8 midterms investigators issued a flurry of subpoenas conducted searches and seized the cellphones of top Trump allies  Highprofile investigative steps included a search in June of the home belonging to Jeffrey Clark a former DOJ official who allegedly sought to use his official government position to overturn Trumps election defeat in key battleground states At one point after the election Trump sought to install Clark as acting attorney general but was dissuaded from doing so after top department officials threatened to resign en masse  Investigators in June also seized the cellphone of John Eastman who authored fringe legal memos for the Trump campaign arguing that thenVice President Mike Pence was authorized to unilaterally refuse to certify Bidens win in the 2020 presidential election  In a separate development a federal judge in California who reviewed the evidence in a related lawsuit determined earlier this year it was more likely than not that the postelection conduct by Trump and Eastman was criminal  The determination by US District Judge David Carter an appointee of former President Clinton arose in a clash between Eastman and the House committee investigating Jan 6 over a subpoena the panel issued for a trove of Eastmans records As such the judges analysis in the case has no direct bearing on whether Trump will face criminal charges  But it was nonetheless stunning for a federal court to find Trump likely culpable for two felonies obstructing an official government proceeding a serious charge that has been brought against hundreds of Capitol riot defendants and conspiracy to defraud the United States Last month the judge further determined that Trump had made sworn statements in court filings and in public that he knew were false as part of his effort to overturn the election results in Georgia  For now the DOJ is reportedly locked in a court battle over whether

special purpose grand jury in Fulton County Georgia on May 2 2022 to look into the actions of former President Donald Trump and his supporters who tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election  An Atlantaarea prosecutors investigation into Trumps effort to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia represents significant legal exposure for the former president legal experts say  Decisions over whether to bring charges in the case may come before the end of the year according to previous statements by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis D and recent reporting on her offices anticipated timeline  Willis has issued numerous subpoenas for testimony before a special grand jury that was impaneled earlier this year to investigate the potentially criminal effort to disrupt the Georgia election  Among the highprofile Trump allies who have received subpoenas are former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows former lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other proTrump attorneys and Sen Lindsey Graham RSC the latter of whom is expected to face questions Tuesday before the grand jury  In an aggressive move this summer the district attorneys office told a group of 16 Republicans who served as a phony slate of proTrump electors in 2020 that they could face criminal charges in the probe  The steps her office has taken including empaneling a special grand jury and subpoenaing

Supreme Courts could still have some say in federal election disputes  Critics say this theory would overturn centuries of common practice and Supreme Court precedents that hold the reference to legislature includes a states entire governing structure  The legislators are urging the court to embrace the radical independent state legislature theory This rests on a literal interpretation of the Constitutions elections clause which says that the manner of federal votes shall be set in each state by the legislature thereof State governors courts or constitutions would not have a say  The US

waters  After three hours of questioning on Wednesday justices appeared split over Moore v Harper a case about political gerrymandering in North Carolina The states Republican legislators are asking the court to overrule the North Carolina Supreme Court which threw out a new map of congressional districts on grounds it was skewed too favorably to the GOP  The US Supreme Court may be headed toward compromise on an important and polarizing case that could greatly affect how congressional and presidential elections are run  The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday morning on a case that could have profound effects on the way elections are run in the United States It is one of the most important and polarizing cases of the current term and the outcome might  maybe  be a compromise  Over three hours the justices probed challenged muttered and at times laughed their way through a case about recent political gerrymandering in North Carolina Looming over the argument in the case of Moore v Harper was the phrase that has energized and frightened court watchers in almost equal measure since the court took up the case in June the independent state legislature theory  The ISL theory  a fringe interpretation of the US Constitutions elections clause that has never been endorsed by a court majority  holds that state legislatures have exclusive power to regulate federal elections free of checks and balances from other branches of state government like the governor or judiciary Simply put Moore asks if a states judiciary has the authority to override the state legislatures redistricting power  Why We Wrote This The US Supreme Court heard arguments in a pivotal case that could make huge waves in how states govern elections But some of the justices appear skeptical of throwing another boulder into Americas electoral waters  Conservative groups say the theory would be a fairer more democratic way to draw congressional maps than what happened in North Carolina The state Supreme Court there struck down the legislatures map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and replaced it with its own  Critics  a broad and ideologically diverse range of them  counter that state courts shouldnt be forbidden by the federal courts from interpreting their own state constitutions Beyond that they argue that giving state legislatures this authority would transform how federal elections are conducted across the country  creating a twotier voting system in which rules procedures and perhaps even rights vary between state and federal elections  Wednesdays argument careened across the legal historical and intellectual map  from the English Bill of Rights to antebellum Virginia from the legal theory of originalism to textualism then to federalism Going in the broad ISL theory had previously been cited approvingly by four conservative justices Coming out there seemed a modicum of agreement that state legislatures shouldnt enjoy unchecked power over setting the rules for federal elections  What a majority could coalesce around is unclear But after two existentially fraught election cycles some of the justices appear wary of throwing another boulder into Americas calming but still tense electoral pond  This is a proposal that gets rid of the normal checks and balances on the way big governmental decisions are made in this country said Justice Elena Kagan And you might think that it gets rid of all those checks and balances at exactly the time when they are needed most  Evelyn HocksteinReuters Timothy Moore speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives speaks to the media outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments in Moore v Harper Dec 7 2022 The case could reshape how federal elections are run  The meaning of legislature  The elections clause of the Constitution states that the Times Places and Manner of holding federal elections shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof The debate in Moore boils down in part to the meaning of the word Legislature  Read to its most extreme ISL proponents say the word means exactly that the states legislature Critics argue the word instead means all governmental branches in a state  an interpretation they note the high court has upheld numerous times over its history Past rulings from the court have held that ballot initiatives gubernatorial vetoes and independent redistricting commissions are all constitutional under the elections clause  David Thompson arguing for the North Carolina legislature said early on they arent saying any of those rulings should be overturned  We accept all the courts precedents added Mr Thompson What cant happen is there cant be a substantive limitation by other state actors on how state legislatures manage federal elections  Much of Wednesdays argument focused then on what those limitations are and when federal courts could apply them Justice Amy Coney Barrett who appears to be one of the justices likely to be decisive in Moore said such limitations would be notoriously difficult lines to draw  Justice Brett Kavanaugh also voiced some skepticism particularly in comparing Mr Thompsons ISL arguments with the interpretation the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist offered in a concurrence to Bush v Gore  The Rehnquist concurrence seemed to acknowledge that state courts would have a role interpreting state law and that federal court review of that should be in his words deferential said Justice Kavanaugh who also worked on the case as part of former President George W Bushs legal team  The critics in Moore he added are okay with that general principle for reviewing state constitutional interpretation but your position seems to go further than that  Chief Justice John Roberts also appeared skeptical of some of Mr Thompsons arguments but the rest of the court appears evenly divided The courts three liberal justices were most critical of the ISL position questioning not just what limitations courts could impose under this theory but the fundamentals of the theory itself  A state legislature would ordinarily be bound by all of the limitations in the state constitution said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson  In the context of the elections clause she added why do those evaporate  The power of state courts  Lawyers for the North Carolina legislature argued that because state legislative power over federal elections derives from the US Constitution the state constitution  and thus state courts  should have little influence  Justices and opposition lawyers nonetheless raised a catalog of issues with the ISL theory  echoing concerns filed in amicus briefs including one signed by the chief justice of every state supreme court in the country Critics of the ISL theory include some of the most prominent conservative judges and lawyers in the US including the cofounder of the Federalist Society a prominent Republican former federal appeals court judge and George W Bushs lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount  To accept North Carolinas claim youd have to ignore the text history and structure of our federal Constitution as well as nearly every state constitution today said Neal Katyal a former acting US solicitor general who represented North Carolina voters and voter advocacy groups  They claim the word legislature means a species of state law that has literally never existed he added State lawmaking unconstrained by a state constitution  that the founders intended to create that animal surely someone would have said something  Instead experts and briefs describe most early state constitutions included requirements for how federal elections should be conducted such as requiring ballots instead of voice votes The framers meanwhile had a welldocumented desire for checks and balances throughout US government  Indeed in terms of originalism  the judicial philosophy that judges should be bound by the original meaning of the Constitutions text which a majority of justices profess to follow  the more you focus on it the weaker the ISL case looks from my vantage point said Vikram Amar dean of the University of Illinois College of Law on a press call last week organized by the Brennan Center for Justice  The original meaning of legislature in the elections clause was clear according to an amicus brief Dean Amar cowrote with a pair of constitutional law professors including Steven Calabresi a cofounder of the Federalist Society State legislatures were created and constrained by the state constitution the brief added and not independent in any context  Most justices on Wednesday didnt devote time to plumbing historical or originalist arguments over the ISL theory Instead they wrestled with that potential compromise  the notoriously difficult lines Justice Barrett described  In that sense fears leading up to the Moore argument that the court could overnight plunge Americas electoral system into chaos and confusion have been somewhat assuaged Setting aside disagreements over text history and original meaning there was some agreement that federal courts could impose new standards on state courts adjudicating gerrymandering claims without revoking state courts judicial review power entirely  Whether a majority of justices are able to find an agreement like that remains to be seen But on the press call last week Eliza SwerenBecker counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center said even a compromise ruling would be unprincipled and result in chaos  Anything short of rejecting the ISL theory wholesale she added asks the court to do something that the court has never done before that flies in the face of history that flies in the face of practice  Michael McConnell a professor at Stanford Law School and a former federal appeals court judge isnt so sure  He agrees that state legislatures created and bound by their state constitutions cant be independent when it comes to federal elections But he thinks the specific reference to legislatures in the elections clause means they should be given some special authority over federal elections  The most plausible the most convincing and also the most practical way to put those oppositions together he says is to say the legislature has to do the actual districting but its subject to standard judicial review  In the current hyperpartisan environment he adds the parties and the amici are all adopting one extreme position or the other instead of looking for a middleground interpretation', 'text_b': None, 'label':

sentence would not have been possible without the zeal the moneyed class has for Silicon Valley startups  When US District Judge Edward Davila ordered prison time for the former CEO last week one thing was pivotal How much money investors had lost because of her crimes  Thats because federal sentencing guidelines what judges use to determine appropriate punishments for people convicted of crimes give more weight to the amount of money lost than anything else in fraud cases  And Theranos like so many buzzy startups was flush with investment cash It raised some 945 million from the likes of media mogul Rupert Murdoch Oracle founder Larry Ellison and former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  Yet Holmes was sentenced for just a fraction of the nearly 1 billion of investment Theranos had raised  Davila identified ten investors who were defrauded and came up with this number 121 million which the judge said was how much investors lost when offset by the amount Theranos stock would have been worth without Holmes deceit  To put it another way Holmes received more than a decade in prison over just about 10 of what Theranos raised  The numbers in Silicon Valley are so out of whack with reality that these guideline sentences become enormous said Jeff Cohen a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Boston College Law School If she were running a widget factory by the same conduct she would have received much less  While other Silicon Valley executives have been accused of wrongdoing Holmes is the first CEO of a major tech firm to be criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison  That means she is the first in the industry to learn that raising hundreds of millions of dollars will not just send a startups valuation soaring but if convicted of fraud in federal court it could make serious prison time all but inevitable  potentially a warning to other imploded tech firms now under scrutiny like Sam BankmanFrieds cryptocurrency exchange FTX  Federal sentencing guidelines consider the amount of money drained the most significant factor in punishing fraudsters because it allows authorities to target organized drug rings and largescale institutional fraud according to former federal prosecutor Bill Portanova  For Silicon Valley if at the end of the day the music stops and theres not enough chairs for everyone the guidelines point to serious punishment said Portanova who is now a defense lawyer in Sacramento Calif  Enlarge this image toggle caption Jeff ChiuAP Jeff ChiuAP  Holmes punishment does come amid signs of a tech sector becoming less frothy Both Big Tech companies and startups are laying off staff new 1 billion companies are becoming harder to spot and venture capital firms are warning of a tough road ahead Has the tech bubble burst or is it about to burst That determination experts say is easier made in hindsight  Tech bubbles dont pop in the way a bubble pops from chewing gum said David Kirsch management professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book about bubbles and crashes Investment bubbles tend to deflate slowly  A long prison sentence for a gross lie  Holmes made patients pharmacies and savvy investors believe Theranos could revolutionize the way blood tests detect diseases when it could do no such thing  Why did she do it Its a question even Davila mused over from the bench before announcing her punishment  What was it that caused Ms Holmes regrettably to make those decisions that she did Davila said Was there a loss of moral compass here he said Was it hubris What caused that Was it intoxication with the fame that comes with being a young entrepreneur  Whatever drove her as soon a jury convicted Holmes she faced serious prison time  The sentencing guidelines after a multitude of factors are considered spits out an offense level Holmes level was 33  24 points of that was from the amount of money she defrauded  And Davila it could be argued could have imposed an even tougher punishment Based on her offense level Holmes sentencing range was between 11 and 14 years behind bars  For context The US Probation Office recommended 9 years Prosecutors asked the judge that Holmes be imprisoned for 15 years The maximum sentence under law was 20 years Holmes legal team requested that she serve her sentence at home and avoid incarceration  Portanova said Holmes punishment involved gobs of money but her actions  repeatedly professing her technology could do what it was incapable of doing  was egregious  She wasnt just an ambitious salesperson who got out over her skis he said She did substantial time because it was a gross lie and she had ample opportunities to stop and she didnt  Will fake it till you make it in Silicon Valley ever change  In their court filing to the judge ahead of the sentencing hearing prosecutors argued that prison time for Holmes was necessary to deter future startup fraud schemes and to rebuild the trust investors must have when funding innovation  But will Holmes incarceration have that effect  Some say the Theranos case could be the start of federal prosecutors policing Silicon Valley more aggressively  In Silicon Valley there has historically been a dont follow the rules mentality because thats how you get ahead said Steven Davidoff Solomon of the UC Berkeley School of Law Holmes may be the first but I suspect there are going to be more  Yet hyping up a product and exaggerating are not crimes but what is a crime is knowingly deceiving investors Sometimes the dividing line is not so clear experts said  Cohen at Boston College of Law said the boundary between embellishment and criminal fraud does indeed remain fuzzy to most in the tech world so chances are slim that Holmes sentence will reverberate in a way that would drastically alter the culture of the industry  Fake it till you make it culture in Silicon Valley involves a certain amount of puffery and here the jury has spoken that there was more than that there was fraud Cohen said  But I do think that its a really hard line to discern he added And Im not hopeful that Silicon Valley will get the message  Kirsch who studies tech entrepreneurs was

assaults on Jewish students and their identity doubled in the 2021 to 2022 academic year particularly on campuses most popular with Jewish students  There were 254 attacks on 63 different college campuses with large Jewish populations with Harvard University the University of Chicago Tufts University UCLA and Rutgers University having the highest number of incidents according to a report by the AMCHA Initiative a Jewish advocacy group that says its findings expose an insidious neverbeforerevealed campus trend  While other watchdog groups such as the AntiDefamation League have broadly examined whether campuses are safe for Jewish students the AMCHA study is unique It investigated the nature scope and trajectory of the threats to Jewish student identity on US campuses and it found a staggering doubling of such threats at 60 percent of schools most popular with Jewish students Instances of bullying and intimidation towards Jewish students for instance tripled in the past year according to the report which tracked incidents at more than 100 colleges and universities in total More broadly threats to Jewish identity rose 100 to 200 percent from the past year according to the findings  With rising antiSemitism in America making front page news as a cadre of prominent celebrities promote conspiracy theories about Jews the situation on Americas college campuses is growing bleaker AntiIsrael and antiZionist movements are fueling this antiSemitic hate according to the AMCHA Initiative which determined that campus faculty and academic departments played a significant role in attacks on Jewish identity The latest findings the AMCHA Initiative warns signal a major crisis for American Jewry  Incidents tracked by the group range from outright attacks on Jews to efforts to suppress proIsrael voices and block them from participating in campus organizations efforts that are reminiscent of the Nazis campaign to eliminate Jewish people from public life  At George Washington University for instance flyers stating Zionists Fuck Off were plastered on the campuss Hillel building a center for Jewish life And at the University of Chicago the Students for Justice in Palestine an antiIsrael group known to engage in violence against Jews launched a campaign dubbed Dont Take Shitty Zionist Classes that urged students to boycott several classes containing a Zionist agenda according to the report A Jewish student at the University of Connecticut was kicked out of an a cappella group because of proIsrael remarks she had made on social media  The threats to Jewish student identity come from their peers professors and even school administrators and reach every corner of campus lifethe quad classrooms dorm rooms student newspaper social media platforms student government and more the report concluded  At schools where faculty members embraced the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement BDS which wages economic warfare on Israel attacks on Jewish students were three to seven times more likely to occur according to the report Around 20 percent of the documented threats to Jewish identity took place during events sponsored by various academic departments highlighting the danger of institutionalized antiIsrael attitudes  More than onethird of antiZionist challenges to wellestablished definitions of Zionism Judaism and antiSemitism took place in programs sponsored by academic departments the report found  The result has been a massive uptick in efforts to bully Jewish students into disavowing their religious identity and support for Israel Campus bids to disconnect Zionism from Judaism and from progressive causes nearly tripled according to the report and the promotion of antiZionist Jews as more authentic than Zionist Jews doubled These efforts are specifically meant to intimidate Jewish students who support Israel and view the Jewish state as a primary aspect of their identity  Additionally calls to rid the campus of Zionism increased more than sixfold and attempts to cancel Israelrelated events programs classes and trips increased nearly fivefold according to the report Efforts to force Jewish students into rejecting trips to Israel also increased nearly 20fold  The pervasive and wellcoordinated attacks on Jewish identity will undoubtedly result in increasing numbers of Jewish students feeling the need to hide their Jewish identity on campus or to detach from Jewish life partially or completely according to the report In the long term the sheer scope of the assault on Jewish student identitywhich is negatively affecting the level of communal identification and participation of an entire generation of young Jewish adultspresages a major crisis for American Jewry  Tammi RossmanBenjamin AMCHAs director told the  these incidents will have lingering effects post college as more and more Jewish young people drop pieces of their Jewish identity to stay safe  On campuses across the nation she said there are efforts to completely strip Jews of our right to even call out antiJewish bigotry when it happens And the irony here is that at a time when identity politics dominate the college scene and everyones individual identities are further defined and further celebrated attempts are being made to chisel away and erase the Jewish identity and deny us the protections from the harassment that

comes months after talk of a samesex marriage bill began on Capitol Hill with little in the way of coordinated messaging from Republicans at the outset  Congress began moving on the Respect for Marriage Act over the summer after the Supreme Courts reversal of abortion protections raised questions about whether it would do the same for samesex marriage protections established by the Obergefell v Hodges decision in 2015  The House passed the bill in July and the Senate voted to proceed with an amended version last week with the support of 12 Republicans  BYRON YORK THE NEEDLESS ACT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE  But some conservatives are objecting to what they describe as inadequate protections for businesses nonprofit groups or people with religious objections to samesex marriage  The Democrats gay marriage bill is all about teeing up the Biden IRS to target religious schools churches and charities Sen Ted Cruz RTX said Monday  The Senate bill pays lip service to religious liberty and conscience rights but it does not offer any meaningful protections for those rights Rep Chip Roy RTX wrote in an oped on Monday Had the Senate sponsors wanted to they could have explicitly stated that no individual or organization could be penalized by the government for operating according to the conviction that marriage unites husband and wife  particularly that the IRS may not strip any such organization of its nonprofit status  Sen Mike Lee RUT has helped lead an effort to delay the final passage of the bill until lawmakers agree to an amendment that would strengthen religious liberty protections beyond whats in the current legislative text  Thats all I want  a protection saying the government may not punish any individual or entity based on a religious or moral convictionbased belief about marriage Lee said on the Senate floor last week That is not too much to ask  In a letter to Senate colleagues on Thursday Lee and 20 other Republican senators argued the Respect for Marriage Act would erode religious liberties even more than the Obergefell decision did  Obergefell did not make a private right of action for aggrieved individuals to sue those who oppose samesex marriage the GOP lawmakers wrote in the letter  It did not create a mandate for the Department of Justice to sue where it perceived an institution opposes samesex marriage but the Respect for Marriage Act will  Conservative critics of the bill argue it lacks any mechanism to prevent government agencies from using it as a legal basis to go after groups that act on their support for traditional marriage  even if the legislative text doesnt specifically grant that power  The fact that there is such hostility toward even having the conversation about strengthening the religious liberty provision has made conservatives really suspect about the intent of the bill Kevin Roberts president of the Heritage Foundation told the   Conservatives were caught flatfooted Roberts said There are too many Republican officials who are cowards  and I use that word very purposefully  on this issue  Lees amendment would bar the government from taking a range of steps against a group or person who speaks or acts in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as a union of one man and one woman or two individuals as recognized under Federal law  Lees amendment defines the discriminatory acts that would violate religious liberty protections instead of just broadly referring to the right of people to hold opposing beliefs about marriage without specifying what that right protects them from  as the bill does now  Government agencies could not end a groups taxexempt status withhold grant money or federal contracts or deny licenses and certifications to groups that oppose samesex marriage according to the amendment  A bipartisan group of senators added an amendment to the legislation last week that was meant to address concerns about religious freedoms including by affirming that people have a right to diverse beliefs about marriage  With that amendment the bill cites existing religious liberty protections and notes that the new samesex marriage law would not erase them  But critics argue the language is too vague to offer meaningful support for religious beliefs They also note that existing protections have not stopped religious groups from facing lawsuits in recent years over their opposition to samesex marriage  While the religious owner of a bakery won a highprofile Supreme Court victory in 2018 for declining to bake a cake for a samesex wedding the ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission was considered narrow because it sided with the baker only because state officials had demonstrated open and personal animosity toward him not necessarily because justices agreed in his right to deny services to a gay couple  The Biden administration has also attempted to use federal funding as leverage to advance its social agenda in other contexts For example the Biden Education Department pushed earlier this year to tie federal funding for schools to expanding transgender rights in sports and bathrooms A judge put that plan on hold  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE   Although 12 Republican senators joined with all Democrats to invoke cloture last week meaning lawmakers voted to avoid a filibuster and limit debate on the bill conservatives are mobilizing to stop the final vote until the Lee amendment is added to the legislation  Of those 12 senators who voted for cloture five of them we believe are movable Roberts said  I was almost uncharacteristically pessimistic when the cloture vote happened he added I am cautiously optimistic that were going to succeed on this one  Roberts said other conservative advocacy groups along with Heritage are coalescing this week around a wonderfully coordinated plan to push for Lees amendment to get added to the Respect for Marriage Act', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

drug dealers At least one of those Xerox copies had the headline translated into Spanish  all the better for the dealers in question most of whom are Honduran nationals to get the message  The photocopies were distributed by Matt Dorsey Supervisor for the district that includes the MidMarket area which is adjacent to the Tenderloin in San Francisco which is both a county and a city Supervisors are the equivalent of City Council members in other cities Dorseys office had organized a neighborhood cleanup and the Supervisor had handed the article for volunteers to promote Dorsey is

priority  a goal he shares with new District Attorney Jenkins  Across San Franciscos Downtown districts rampant drug use and dealing has led to a surge in crime overdoses and homelessness With office workers staying home and residents fleeing for safer ground only a major shift of political will can prevent the problems from getting worse AP  Strange as it might sound to most nonSan Franciscans the kind of overt political opposition to open drug dealing that Dorsey and Jenkins represent is a challenge to the citys political establishment San Francisco is governed by a leadership that is so enamored of the citys progressive humanitarian selfimage that the idea of enforcing basic laws  even ones that save peoples lives like controlling drug sales and consumption  has come to be regarded as reactionary But conditions in the city have gotten so bad that San Franciscos voters have begun to revolt Living in a city whose downtown doubles as an outdoor drug den is becoming intolerable even for many notoriously tolerant San Franciscans  Open drug use has been normalized to the point there are blocks where the entire sidewalk is filled with people passed out or getting high said Kevin Lee

prepandemic aspirations of a oncebooming San Francisco Located underground beneath a colossal tower of luxury apartments for tech workers the 65000 square foot market was expected to ride the coattails of the citys exploding knowledge economy  Instead like the rest of the neighborhood the Whole Foods has become a hotbed of petty crime According to interviews with workers there restrooms now include disposal containers for syringes because addicts from the open air drug market that surrounds the building use the toilet stalls as shooting galleries Those addicts treat the stores shelves as a veritable ATM brazenly shoplifting merchandise in clear view of both Whole Foods employees and police officers working overtime shifts on the stores floor  Dorsey hoped these oldfashioned Xerox copies of a recent newspaper article detailing new crime policies would scare outofcontrol drug peddlers  This massive Whole Foods in the MidMarket district was supposed to serve deeppocketed tech workers instead its been invaded by drugusers Google Maps  Once a security guard tried to stop an addict from stealing and was thrown through plate glass near the cheese counter Another security guard who came to his assistance was strangled Management started keeping frequently stolen products in the rear stockroom theyre brought out to customers at the registers upon purchase Undeterred addicts simply began walking into the employeesonly section of the store and rifling through coolers and boxes for coveted merchandise  The once ubiquitous tech workers that were expected to patronize the store are hardly seen in MidMarket anymore When companies began shifting to workfromhome downtown San Franciscos office buildings emptied out By 2024 one study estimates that MidMarket commercial real estate will have a vacancy rate of 43 percent compared to barely 6 percent citywide before the pandemic Prior to the pandemic tech workers on hoverboards coexisted awkwardly with homeless people

Walgreens and every other big box store in downtown San Francisco is sold to fences on the sidewalks of the nearby Mission District which brings the organized larceny industry to that mostly residential neighborhood as well Addicts attracted to San Francisco by the Tenderloins notoriety live in tent encampments scattered all over the city In addition to shoplifting addicts support their habits by breaking into cars and occasionally invading homes The effects of the open air drug market thus ripple through every nook and cranny of San Francisco  San Francisco is a famously tolerant city but beneath this lowlevel mayhem the citys residents who pay some of the highest taxes in the world have been seething at their political leaders  often privately and increasingly publicly The publics exasperation with the political establishment erupted twice already first with the recall of the citys comedically woke school board members in February followed by the recall of former DA Chesa Boudin four months later  Former District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled earlier this year by voters fed up with his softoncrime policies that saw drug deaths and dealing skyrocket AP  Having been appointed in the wake of Boudins demise new DA Jenkins is currently running to be formally elected to her office next month Boudin was a career public defense attorney who essentially turned the prosecutors HQ into a second public defenders office He made a point of avoiding felony prosecutions for drug dealers painting them as victims of human trafficking On Boudins watch dealers became more brazen than ever barely bothering to conceal their transactions while fatal drug overdoses surged in the city claiming more than twice as many lives over the course of the pandemic as Covid Meanwhile Boudins office secured just three convictions for drug dealing in the entire year of 2021 and zero for peddling fentanyl All while some Honduran dealers are making upwards of 1000 per day according to reports from former and current Assistant District Attorneys  Nevertheless most of the citys political establishment with the waffling exception of the Mayor stood firmly behind Boudin Only one of the 11 Supervisors supported the former DAs recall The San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee opposed the recall and recently endorsed Jenkins opponent  a candidate who is if anything even more radical than Boudin  in next months election  San Franciscos notoriously difficult homelessness problem is part of the reason its Downtown lags behind all major American cities in postpandemic economic recovery REUTERS  New San Francisco DA Brooke Jenkins is tougher on crime than her predecessor shes currently campaigning to keep her job and faces a November election AP  Much of San Franciscos political establishment along with the citys Democratic Party has become estranged from the citys heavily Democratic voters said Randy Shaw head of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic which provides housing to indigent San Franciscans Voters rejected the Partybacked Boudin in a landslide yet the Party has gone on to endorse a Boudinbacker against an appointed DA who campaigned for the recall  This has put Jenkins in the strange and politically envious position of being able to run against San Franciscos political machine even though shes the handpicked appointee of the Mayor Thanks to an ideologically intoxicated progressive political establishment increasingly outofstep with San Franciscos voters in next months election Jenkins is at once an insider and an outsider She can have her cake and eat it too  Former San Francisco School Board members Gabriela López l Alison Collins center and Faauuga Moliga r were recalled after focusing on woke issues like renaming schools rather than getting kids back into classrooms during the pandemic  San Franciscos politics are in the early stages of a realignment But that doesnt mean things will change overnight The citys challenges going forward are even worse than those behind it Among the 62 largest cities in America San Francisco already ranks dead last in the postpandemic recovery of its downtown That problem is only going to worsen as commercial real estate contracts that were signed at the height of the tech boom expire and fail to be renewed because employees are now working from home  Meanwhile the citys openair drug problems are likely to become even more dire as a trio of new supervised drugs sites are soon to debut never mind that their infamous predecessor was a spectacular and illegal public failure Downtown will thus continue to be a ghost town thanks to city leaders whose policies embolden drug dealers and users with little or no consequence  Empty office towers and retail shops are now common across Downtown San Francisco The situation will only worsen as additional leases reach their expiration dates Bloomberg via Getty Images  My son is stuck with politicians who just hand addicts free drug paraphernalia and double down on the same failed policies said Jacqui Berlinn who has tried for years to save her son who is a homeless addict in the Tenderloin We finally have a new DA who wants to bring real change but she cant do it until the rest of the citys political leaders start working toward a real solution instead of making the crisis worse  As mounting office vacancies begin to chisel away at the tax base of a city whose social service needs are ballooning with the worsening addiction crisis we might soon see city agencies warring over limited resources exacerbating the political split between progressives and pragmatists  The present dysfunction of San Francisco may thus be just a harbinger of a full blown crisis to come Then again given what passes for governance in San Francisco during normal times perhaps a crisis is just what the city needs to bring it back from the edge of the abyss', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

CBCs Opinion section please see the FAQ  This years Pride Month is starting with a Lego set  Pride Month is celebrated every year in honour of the Stonewall Inn riots that took place in June 1969 as well as the yearly demonstrations that followed in various cities across the US and eventually the world Pride reminds us of the violence endured the progress made and the hardships yet to come  Today  the beginning of Pride Month in Canada  Lego is releasing a 346piece LGBTQ themed set titled Everyone is Awesome a clear nod to the massively popular song written for the 2014 Lego Movie which undoubtedly traumatized many parents teachers and caregivers alike after the movie came out due to how many kids were singing it nonstop  surpassed only by Baby Shark  Its one of the signs of how June 1 has become the start of a rainbowthemed marketing onslaught from every corner of the capitalist system Companies of all types and sizes use Pride Month to market pridethemed consumables decorate their stores with rainbow regalia and hammer customers with lacklustre slogans  only to pack it all up after June 30  This phenomenon is known among the queer community as rainbow capitalism Its pandering pure and simple  Every year rainbow capitalism is met with a range of responses from outright disdain to excited cheers The two camps that tend to form around this phenomenon represent a sort of chicken or the egg paradox  One camp argues that companies are simply using queer existence and exploitation for profit often without any form of support for the queer community  In doing so they say these companies perpetuate inequality and oppression How various identities intersect will determine the type and degree of inequality and oppression that they experience in their own individual communities as well as society at large and for many capitalism has been a vehicle for harmful policies including neocolonialism gentrification and upholding white supremacist institutions  A rainbow flag is seen in Toronto during Pride Month Views about rainbow capitalism and Pride Month marketing initiatives are mixed writes Aimee Langer Eduardo LimaCanadian Press  The second camp acknowledges that while profiting from queer peoples open existence is not ideal its inevitable everyone needs to buy things queer people included Many LGBTQ people experience barriers to full economic participation due to hiring discrimination or hostile work environments leaving them disproportionately represented in lowincome categories Being picky about whether companies are genuinely committed to LGBTQ welfare leaves even fewer options  This camp also argues that explicit representation such as rainbow signage that takes over storefronts during Pride Month can be encouraging even if shallow At minimum it signals acceptance If you must spend your money somewhere why not at a place that says We support you  The first camp perceives the phenomenon of rainbow capitalism as being a selfinterested reflection of the public acceptance and normalization that has accumulated over decades of activism The second views it as a propagating force for that acceptance and normalization purely for the explicit representation that occurs over an entire month  So  what came first The chicken or the egg Acceptance or exploitation  Much like what quantum physicists believe the truth is likely that both are true simultaneously You can be frustrated about irresponsible and disingenuous pandering but still acknowledge the inevitability of capitalist participation  And this is the sweet spot for change  Real change necessitates that companies do their pandering in good faith This means consequential engagement support and policies not just during Pride Month but yearround  It also means that we queer and straight people alike need to demand that the pandering be done in good faith This can include putting pressure on companies to truly embrace meaningful change by  Demanding workplace policies to develop inclusive work environments  Hiring LGBTQ people at all levels including highlevel corporate positions  Planning and running community events that promote LGBTQ interests arts and businesses  Creating partnership and mentorship initiatives with queer businesses  Providing internships through universities and high schools  And creating capital grant programs for queer entrepreneurs  There are a million ways that companies can sincerely engage with queer folk and communities yearround that will help our community become more normalized and accepted and keep us spending our money  And so many ways we can all help encourage that engagement  For my part Ill probably buy that Lego set But Im also going to donate 50 to the Queer Education Foundation to support their mission to create inclusive and intersectional spaces', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

Article Share  The faster the better the workers were told at the height of the coronavirus pandemic as the littleknown financial technology company Blueacorn raced to review small businesses that sought federal loans Speeding through applications Blueacorn employees and contractors allegedly began to overlook possible signs of fraud according to interviews and communications later amassed by investigators on Capitol Hill The company weighed whether to prioritize monster loans that will get everyone paid as the firms cofounder once said And investigators found that Blueacorn collected about 1 billion in processing fees  while its operators may have secured fraudulent loans of their own  The allegations against Blueacorn and several other firms are laid out in a sprawling roughly 120page report released Thursday by the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis a congressional watchdog tasked to oversee roughly 5 trillion in federal pandemic aid The 18month probe  spanning more than 83000 pages of documents and shared in advance with The   contends there was rampant abuse among a set of companies known as fintechs which jeopardized federal efforts to rescue the economy and siphoned off public funds for possible private gain  Some of the companies involved had never before managed federal aid the report found At the height of the pandemic they failed to hire the right staff to thwart fraud They amassed major profits from fees generated from the loans  large and small genuine and problematic  that they processed and reviewed And they repeatedly escaped scrutiny from the Small Business Administration putting billions of dollars at risk the probe found  Advertisement  The trouble began under the Trump administration after Congress first authorized the Paycheck Protection Program PPP in 2020 The roughly 800 billion initiative saw the government disburse more than 11 million loans to companies at risk of shutting their doors for good helping keep them afloat until the health emergency eased But the money became a tempting target for malicious actors who took advantage of lax rules  and inadequate oversight  to bilk the government for staggering sums  Fintech companies including Blueacorn Womply and Kabbage were supposed to serve as middlemen  helping applicants complete paperwork and processing their requests for aid on behalf of banks and other large financial institutions In some cases though the digital firms instead became vectors for the worst waste fraud and abuse according to congressional investigators led by Rep James E Clyburn DSC the panels chairman  At Blueacorn for example loan reviewers tied to the company told the select committee they were pressured to push through PPP applications even if they seemed suspicious The company was especially interested in processing highdollar applications the report stated even creating a special internal VIPPP label to ensure the biggest borrowers  which carried the promise of great fees  could receive expedited treatment  The approach may have cost the government though House investigators could not compute a final sum It also came at the expense of smaller

disburse billions of Paycheck Protection Program dollars to struggling small businesses efficiently and expeditiously refused to take adequate steps to detect and prevent fraud despite their clear responsibility to safeguard taxpayer funds Clyburn said in a statement The allegations underscore the challenge that the US government faced amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression Totaling more than 5 trillion the countrys generous covid aid helped rescue millions of families workers and businesses from financial ruin even as it emerged as a tempting target for grift large and small The Post has found in its yearlong investigation the Covid Money Trail The losses have been especially stark at the SBA an agency tasked at the height of the pandemic to administer about 1 trillion in loans and grants As it rescued businesses the agency systematically failed to take proper care of its funds opening the door for criminals around the world to use stolen or false information to obtain limited pandemic aid Repeatedly the SBAs inspector general Hannibal Mike Ware has joined other federal watchdogs in needling the agency for its poor oversight In one early estimate Ware said there could be more than 4 billion in PPPrelated fraud adding the losses are likely to grow as scrutiny of the program continues Yet fintech companies presented a special challenge to PPP The firms were seen as critical in expanding access to capital particularly for smaller borrowers which could not obtain easy help during the pandemic from larger traditional lenders such as banks But some fintech startups had few if any preexisting relationships with needy businesses And in their haste to come online the companies may not have been as diligent in scrutinizing PPP applications experts later discovered The involvement of fintech lenders in the paycheck was definitely a doubleedged sword said Nick Schwellenbach a senior investigator at the Project On Government Oversight a watchdog group A lot of fintechs but not all really exercised insufficient due diligence in vetting loan applicants and as a result are disproportionately represented in the loans that have been deemed fraudulent or potentially fraudulent  Congressional investigators last year came to identify six firms in particular  Blueacorn BlueVine Cross River Bank Celtic Bank Kabbage and Womply  that they believed were associated with potentially fraudulent loans Their report released Thursday issued after the committee requested an intricate series of records from these and other companies shed new light on what Clyburn described as troubling business practices that have cost the government immensely  At Kabbage a fintech firm later acquired by American Express the companys own workers repeatedly shared concerns in private about fraud risks In the earliest days of the pandemic loan program an unnamed employee remarked to their supervisor in July 2020  according to internal chat records later obtained by the House committee  their fear that the level of fraud were reviewing is wildly underestimated  Kabbage like many fintech companies sought to streamline the process for small businesses to obtain PPP loans It pitched potential customers on the premise that it had helped a wide array of firms  restaurants retailers shrimp boat operators and beekeepers to name a few  obtain aid through the program even when big banks had stopped accepting new applicants The company in 2020 said its efforts alone had helped save about 945000 jobs  But the committee said that senior officials at Kabbage seemed to miss obvious flags for fraud  incorrect tax documents names and addresses that didnt match on applications identities that may have been stolen and profit margins that didnt make sense Internally its leaders appeared to dismiss the warning signs too Explaining its approach a risk manager at Kabbage acknowledged in a separate exchange obtained by Congress that they took a more lax view on PPP lending because the risk here is not ours  it is SBAs sic risk  Advertisement  Another Kabbage policy official put it more bluntly over email in September 2020 using a profanity to blast the SBAs rules that created the fraud  For Kabbage the consequences became apparent in October 2020 after American Express acquired much of the company leaving a portion of its remaining PPP loan portfolio to a new entity called KServicing That company filed for bankruptcy two years later as agents for KServicing said its outstanding PPP loans  roughly 13 billion  had become overburdened by ongoing disputes and open investigations  KServicing did not immediately respond to a request for comment It said in its October bankruptcy filing that it has successfully serviced approximately 80 percent of its PPP loans It added that it vigorously disputed allegations of fraud citing probes by the Justice Department and the work of the Houses select committee  PPP did not just provide financial support to businesses facing a sudden drop in customers as the pandemic forced people to stay home The law setting the program up also allowed major banks and other firms to collect fees based on the sizes of the loans they processed Lenders then paid some of those fees to fintech companies which helped recruit applicants and vet them for potential trouble  In August 2021 researchers at the University of Texas at Austin painted a staggering picture of those earnings They estimated that PPP appeared to generate about 38 billion in fees for lenders about 86 billion of which ultimately went to fintech companies The numbers led the reports authors to conclude that the pandemic program had the potential to be a profitable business for its participants  Before the pandemic the fintech company Womply had supplied other businesses with marketing software Then arrived PPP which helped spur the company to put together what it branded as a fast lane service in February 2021  a way to market underwrite and vet PPP applications on behalf of major lenders  The endeavor would prove profitable for Womply which over the life of the program earned more than 2 billion in fees lawmakers found But officials at one lender that worked with Womply  in conversations with congressional investigators detailed in the report  said it had earned that money even as it ignored rampant fraud  Advertisement  That lender a Floridabased company called Benworth later indicated in an email that Womply had placed our company in a very bad predicament due to the high likelihood of fraud in its referred loans Citing significant glitches in its systems to evaluate loans another described Womplys fraudprevention efforts as put together with duct tape and gum according to an email cited in the report  The report alleges that Womply itself may have received federal funds improperly Congressional investigators said the company in 2020 and 2021 obtained about 7 million in PPP aid This September however the SBA determined Womply was ineligible to receive the aid  after the company requested to have its loans forgiven  Womplys chief executive Toby Scammell signed key loan documents seeking the governments permission to waive its outstanding debts according to the panel Scammell who previously pleaded guilty in 2014 to federal insider trading charges ran his businesss stimulus fraud prevention efforts investigators alleged  The lawmakers report contends that Scammell later resisted providing key documents to the SBA and its inspector general in the course of their fraud investigations Congressional aides also alleged that Womply transferred millions of PPP applicants tax and banking information to a new company Solo Global for unclear purposes  Solo Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment  For taxpayers the risk that even larger sums of money may be lost to fraud remains great  Under PPP Congress allowed the SBA to forgive the loans of eligible borrowers provided they followed the rules particularly by maintaining their payrolls Lawmakers wanted to ensure the money could keep Americans employed  while sparing hardhit small employers from debts that they might struggle later to repay  By October 93 percent of PPP recipients had some or all of their balances forgiven according to the SBAs data But the high degree of forgiveness  and the lack of internal oversight  prompted the agencys inspector general to warn in March that the government probably was forgiving PPP loans for potentially fraudulent and ineligible applicants  Its pretty clear there are a lot of suspicious loans being forgiven said Sam Kruger an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business who has studied the role of fintechs in pandemic lending  The losses also have added to pressure on the Justice Department which tapped Kevin Chambers this year to oversee the governments work to find and prosecute pandemicrelated crimes This spring federal prosecutors said they had brought charges and secured convictions involving more than 8 billion in misused covid funds a significant portion of which includes PPP and other aid administered by the SBA  On Thursday Clyburn and his aides called on federal watchdogs to conduct further investigation into these companies and pursue all appropriate remedies That could include Blueacorn a firm founded by Nathan Reis Hockridge and other entrepreneurs in 2020 to facilitate PPP loans They advertised free money and loan approvals in less than 30 seconds according to their marketing materials drawing a flood of applicants Reis did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Over the life of the loan program the company would process roughly 125 billion in PPP loans a level of involvement in 2021 greater than even the giant multinational bank JPMorgan Chase the report found Blueacorn ultimately would reap more than 1 billion in taxpayerfunded fees according to congressional investigators who said the company invested few of those dollars into oversight while enabling potentially widespread abuse  Advertisement  Working on behalf of its lending partners Blueacorn was supposed to oversee fraud and identity verification and other borrower support But company workers and contractors would later tell congressional investigators that they were illequipped for the task One witness claimed they submitted 300 PPP loans to the SBA before they even received training  The more you submit the more we get paid one worker said they were told by Blueacorn management  In doing so Blueacorn often prioritized the largest applicants seemingly hoping to extract the most in taxpayerfunded fees the report alleged In a Slack message obtained by the committee and cited in the document Hockridge at one point called loan reviewers attention to a fire  a 19 million loan that had been in the underwriting process for five days  I dont need to tell you how much Blueacorn makes off of that loan alone she wrote  Most of the fraud reviews ultimately fell to outside firms the report found including littleknown enterprises such as Elev8 Advisors The company an Arizonabased firm led by Adam and Kristen Spencer hired family members and friends with seemingly no connection to the financial sector and with no apparent experience in financial crime compliance fraud prevention or underwriting according to the probe  In an unsigned statement the company accused the House subcommittee of engaging in unfair and misleading tactics promising a more fulsome rebuttal to come  This report represents an unfortunate politicization of an important function of our government the statement said Congress responsibilities to the constituents they were elected to represent does not include engineering misleading and disparaging headlines for political gains  The statement added that Elev8 Advisors did not engage in any selfdealing and their own loans were completely appropriate and would pass muster in any objective review  The congressional report also alleged the Blueacorn founders Reis and Hockridge personally obtained about 300000 in PPP loans in ways that raised congressional investigators suspicions In one application for example Reis indicated he was an African American veteran contradicting information he submitted in the context of other PPP requests The report claims the duo lived lavishly as a result of their enterprise pointing to a video that showed Reis showing off large amounts of cash in a bar  GiftOutline Gift Article', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

the full extent of that harm was immediately seen in 2015 she said  Narcotics agents say streetlevel demand for fentanyl is rising fast because so many new users are getting hooked More than 9 million Americans misused opioids in 2020 according to the latest estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services But the agency has not tracked the rise of fentanyl and does not know how many Americans are using it  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is unable to track overdose deaths in realtime Its published data is one year behind obscuring the picture of what is happening on the ground in 2022 The agency continues to count the death toll for 2021  in a provisional tally seven months ago it calculated the overall number of drug overdoses at 107622 Twothirds were due to fentanyl  When President Richard M Nixon launched Americas first war on drugs 51 years ago annual overdose deaths stood at 6771  There is one federal system that collects both fatal and nonfatal overdose data in realtime in several regions of the country But the system called ODMAP is kept from public view A database launched by the drug czars office last week maps some nonfatal overdoses which can highlight regions where deaths are likely to follow  Without comprehensive data the federal government is driving blind  This is like tracking the epidemic by visiting cemeteries said John P

consequences and where to put resources to buffer those health consequences Our drugcontrol strategy is an embarrassment and it doesnt begin to propose a way of reversing this problem  The American fentanyl crisis deepened during the coronavirus pandemic From 2019 to 2021 fatal overdoses surged 94 percent and an estimated 196 Americans are now dying each day from the drug  the equivalent of a

prescription opioids while US drug manufacturers distributors and chain pharmacies made billions in profits  During the Obama administration amid a wider questioning of the US criminal justice system the government defunded and dismantled key drugmonitoring programs in the years before fentanyl hit President Barack Obama demoted the White House drug czar position removing the role from the Cabinet And when heroin use rose after the government crackdown on prescription opioids authorities treated fentanyl as an additive rather than a distinct threat requiring its own specific strategy  Story

build a wall along the US southern border that he said would stop drugs But Mexican traffickers were sneaking fentanyl right through the front door hidden in passenger vehicles and commercial trucks

deadliest drug US agents have ever faced  Since President Biden took office his administration has amplified a public messaging campaign to warn about fentanyls mortal threat  One Pill Can Kill He has stepped up efforts to improve scanning technology at border crossings and repair a broken counternarcotics partnership with Mexico But with Republicans blaming Bidens border policies for record

Salwan GeorgesThe   When the US government cracked down on the US opioid industry starting in 2005 it choked off street supplies of prescription narcotics but left behind a ravenous market Mexican cartels filled it first with crude heroin then fentanyl The cartels imported drugs and chemicals from China hired chemists and purchased pill presses But at the moment when the federal agencies responsible for preventing the drug from gaining a foothold in America were needed most they fell short  The amount of fentanyl seized along the US southern border  the most reliable gauge of supply  has jumped ninefold during the past five years Since July border seizures of fentanyl have averaged 2200 pounds a month meaning US authorities are confiscating more fentanyl in a single month than they did during all of 2018 Federal officials estimate they are capturing 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl crossing from Mexico but they acknowledge it could be less  The drug is cheaper than ever because supplies are so abundant On the streets of US cities in the early 2000s the most popular prescription pain pill was made by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals one of the nations oldest drug manufacturers The companys 30milligram oxycodone tablets known as blues or M30s sold for roughly 30 apiece on the black market Today fake M30s made by Mexican cartels using fentanyl look identical but

narcotics agents and prosecutors who worked with him threw a farewell party at the Tin Roof a honkytonk bar downtown in the citys renovated Gaslamp Quarter  I cant say we made progress said Sherri Walker Hobson a tough laserfocused former federal prosecutor who worked closely with Byrne raising a toast to her best friend as the bar went quiet But we put up a good fight We did the best we could to manage this  San Diegos Gaslamp Quarter is lined with pricey new restaurants and oldstyle saloons that evoke the citys history They share the streets with thousands of people sleeping in tents and alleys many gripped by addiction  A few stood outside the Tin Roof just beyond the sidewalk tables on the night of Byrnes farewell At one point a grubby disheveled man with bulging eyes walked into the party and sat down among the cops He didnt speak but he appeared to be under the influence of something powerful  When one of the bartenders noticed and came onto the floor to confront him the man ran to the back of the restaurant Two of the plainclothes narcotics officers from Byrnes party followed They shooed the man out of the bar and back onto the street  Members of a US drug task force

By 2017 fentanyl had become the leading cause of overdose deaths in America For three years Hobson then an assistant US attorney in San Diego had been tracking the steady rise in fentanyl seizures at the busiest land port in the nation  San Ysidro 20 miles south of downtown San Diego Fentanyl deaths had quadrupled in San Diego County between 2014 and 2017  In the spring of 2017 Hobson formed the Fentanyl Working Group a collection of federal and state drug agents prosecutors and chemists along with the medical examiner and other public health officials It amounted to an emergency summit Byrne joined the cause They were hoping for a turnout of 15 people Forty showed up  The group began to collect drug overdose and seizure data and quickly realized that the doses of fentanyl that had been causing so many deaths in San Diego and across the country were coming from cartels in Mexico not from traffickers in China  China was in the rearview mirror Hobson said  Sherri Walker Hobson served as a lead prosecutor of fentanyl cases in San Diego as an assistant US attorney Salwan GeorgesThe   Hobson and her colleagues tried to spread the word They launched a local public awareness campaign They created fact sheets and PowerPoint presentations to alert law enforcement agencies in the region Hobson traveled the country speaking at national drug policy conferences where she sounded the alarm about the flood of fentanyl coming from Mexico  From 2016 to 2017 fentanyl seizures at Californias ports of entry rose by 266 percent from 573 pounds to 2099 Most involved counterfeit M30 pills At the time 22 pounds of fentanyl cost about 40000 That amount could be turned into 1 million pills netting the cartels millions in profit  Hobson knew how the cartels operated because she had been prosecuting methamphetamine cases since the 1990s The San Diego region had been a hub for smallbatch USmade biker meth Then Mexican traffickers figured out how to cook it cheaper and make it purer They put competitors north of the border out of business  I think a lot of people underestimated the Mexican cartels Hobson who retired in 2020 after 30 years with the US attorneys office in San Diego said in a recent interview I knew they were very innovative They werent hesitant to adapt and try new things  Scanning equipment at the Otay Mesa port of entry helped US border authorities make a

warnings went largely unheeded  The importation of fentanyl from Mexico was not the focus of the Trump administration In October 2017 a Justice Department official said in an oped column that most illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues come from China  The department announced an indictment against Chinese nationals furthering the narrative that China was paramount Reading through the indictment Hobson realized that the allegations were old dating back to 2014 and 2015 By 2017 it was clear to Hobson and members of the Fentanyl Working Group that the supply lines had shifted  There was so much focus on China they didnt look at where the ball was Hobson said They werent looking at the cartels in a serious way It was all about China China China  Story continues below advertisement

a case in 2017 that confirmed the lightningfast rise of the Mexican cartels On Aug 11 a US Customs and Border Protection officer stationed at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package from China containing a chemical called 4ANPP a precursor used to make fentanyl Byrne and Hobson along with agents from the DEA and the US Postal Inspection Service devised a plan  The team replaced the precursor with a bag of sand put a tracking device on the package and followed it to San Diego It was delivered to a post office box near the border linked to a man named Cesar Daleo Byrne recognized the name from his days working as a US Border Patrol agent before he joined Homeland Security Investigations Daleo was once a Border Patrol agent too  The team members decided to allow Daleo to pick up the parcel It would be the 14th time that he had signed for such a package since 2016 They hoped Daleo would take the interstate offramp from San Ysidro into Mexico If he took the bait and drove onto the ramp he would be making a commitment to entering Mexico The team could then prove in court that the precursor chemicals were bound for the cartels  On Aug 29 2017 Daleo picked up the parcel and opened the box severing a hairline surveillance wire and sounding an alarm to the team He tossed the box containing the bag of sand into his trunk and headed south taking the offramp to Mexico A Homeland Security tactical team cut him off One of the agents tossed a stun grenade at Daleos car He crashed into a guardrail The agents smashed Daleos drivers side window dragged him through it onto the ramp and carted him off in handcuffs  Byrne arrests former Border Patrol agent Cesar Daleo in 2017 after Daleo tried to smuggle fentanyl precursor chemicals into Mexico Courtesy of Sherri Walker Hobson  Daleo later pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 30 months in prison For the first time Byrne and Hobson had unassailable proof that the cartels were making their own fentanyl and cutting out the middlemen  It was a game changer Byrne said  But in Washington fentanyl was barely registering on the radar screen  That year the DEA published a 94page resource document that devoted four pages to synthetic opioids It made no mention that Mexican traffickers were producing fentanyl Under Drugs of Concern fentanyl was not listed In the DEAs 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment the agency devoted 10 of 169 pages to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids US law enforcement agencies surveyed by the DEA identified heroin as the greatest threat facing the nation followed by meth and prescription drugs Fentanyl came in fourth slightly ahead of marijuana  A memorial to people who have died from fentanyl lines the walls at the headquarters of the US Drug Enforcement Agency Jorge RibasThe   There were other missteps In the years before fentanyl hit the streets crucial programs to monitor drug use were dismantled  One the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program gathered urine samples from recent offenders The program run by the White House drug czar was scuttled in 2013 by budget cuts  The Drug Abuse Warning Network which collected drug use and overdose data from hospitals and emergency responders was eliminated in 2011 The government brought back a version of the program in 2018 but by then the fentanyl crisis was well underway  These programs as imperfect as they were at least gave us something And they were defunded said Keith Humphreys who served as a drug policy adviser to the George W Bush and Obama administrations  Drug agents confiscated nearly 1 million fentanyl pills at an Inglewood Calif home in July Drug loads that cross the border often go to stash houses in the Los Angeles area Drug Enforcement Administration  Soon after Trump became president his administration proposed eliminating the drug czars office entirely It became a backwater for political appointees many of them with scant or no drug policy expertise A 23yearold Trump campaign worker was named deputy chief of staff but no one had been nominated to head the office Nearly nine months into his presidency Trump selected Rep Tom Marino RPa  a former federal prosecutor and one of Trumps first and most strident supporters in Congress  to be drug czar But Marino soon withdrew his nomination after it was revealed in a joint 60 Minutes investigation that he had cosponsored legislation that made it more difficult for the DEA to hold drug manufacturers distributors and pharmacies accountable when they violated federal law  As the Trump administration was preparing to leave the White House in 2021 the drug czars office issued its annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress The document is supposed to detail the governments plan to reduce drug demand and disrupt supply chains But the 2021 strategy document was nearly identical to the one issued in 2020 Many of its sections had simply been copied from the

was the youngest person in San Diego to die because of fentanyl Since then the drug has killed two other children there before their first birthdays  Byrne and Hobson investigated the Holz case tracing the pills to a drug ring that included a US citizen in Tijuana named April Spring Kelly She told prosecutors she used heavyset women as body carriers because they were less likely to be patted down and sent them through Arizona and California crossings  Couriers were smuggling packages taped to their thighs and abdomens or in body cavities Stuffers as the agents called them could sneak a pound of pills or powder through a port of entry Kelly admitted in a plea agreement to smuggling nearly half a million fentanyl pills across the border She was sentenced to 14 years  US Customs and Border Protection officers inspect vehicles at Otay Mesa a major smuggling gateway for the cartels Salwan GeorgesThe   The Trump administration was less focused on drugs than immigration Trump officials were preparing to award contracts worth billions of dollars for the presidents border wall and they invited construction firms to set up sidebyside prototype designs on a dusty lot near the Otay Mesa crossing 27 miles south of downtown San Diego The region was a natural choice The fencing CBP had installed along the border there over the previous two decades was more formidable than anywhere else  What Trump officials didnt acknowledge was that the barriers made little difference to the cartels The place with the mightiest fence was also the traffickers primary gateway for hard drugs  The cartels saw the void left by the US pharmaceutical industry said John Callery a 30year veteran of the DEA who retired after running the San Diego field office Nature abhors a vacuum and they said Holy crap We only have to get five pounds of fentanyl across the border instead of 7000 pounds of meth Perfect And we can make 10 times as much money  Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement  In the summer of 2018 a hardcharging local prosecutor in San Diego named Terri Perez proposed setting up Team 10 to investigate every fentanyl death and trace the drugs to the dealers The team was headquartered at the DEAs San Diego field office and staffed by federal and local law enforcement officers from across the region  I had never seen anything like this Its impacting people from their early teens to their 40s and 50s families being destroyed parents losing their kids schools losing their students Perez said We needed to hold people accountable  Perez turned to Byrne He started to investigate dozens of overdose deaths comforting family members while trying to gain access to the cellphones of the dead for leads  Byrne and Hobson knew they were seeing only a small fraction of the drugs pouring across the border And what they were hearing from DEA agents was not encouraging Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was critical of his countrys drug war partnership with the United States and argued that it burdened Mexico unfairly and fueled violence  Once López Obrador took office in December 2018 security and counternarcotics relationships with the United States had gone cold He was distrustful of the DEA and the access US agents had cultivated across the Mexican government  In Washington Trump had declared the opioid epidemic a national health emergency and pressured China to crack down on fentanyl shipments to the United States But his administrations focus at the border was to stop immigration Trump who falsely said Mexico would pay for the border wall wanted the Democrats to provide 5 billion for the project He shut down the government toward the end of 2018 when they wouldnt give it to him  The impasse ended after 35 days and led to a compromise on border security Democrats agreed to furnish 14 billion for the wall Republicans agreed to provide 564 million to add moreadvanced nonintrusive inspection technology known as NII at the ports of entry  We asked What would it take to stop the flow of drugs Could we do a Manhattan Project for NII said a congressional staffer who worked closely on the funding plan but wasnt authorized to speak publicly  More than 228000 cars and trucks were entering the United States each day from Mexico but CBP officers were scanning only about 6 percent of commercial trucks and 1 percent of passenger vehicles  Seized vehicles at an impound lot near Otay Mesa Many were used to smuggle drugs from Mexico Salwan GeorgesThe   Mexican traffickers were playing those odds and winning They could send the stuffers through the crossings or just load the drugs into cars and trucks and shrug off whatever losses they incurred as the price of doing business  The border security plan that emerged in 2019 after the shutdown promised to change that calculus Congressional appropriators set a goal for CBP to scan 72 percent of commercial trucks and 40 percent of passenger vehicles entering from Mexico  To reach that objective CBP needed software systems capable of processing the millions of images from the stateoftheart scanning equipment That required artificial intelligence to help agents quickly detect hidden compartments altered engine parts and other anomalies  The threedimensional scans couldnt find fentanyl buried deep in an engine block but they could detect suspicious changes in densities The drug loads show up as glowing bright spots because the Xrays pass through them so easily CBP officers could route those vehicles to additional inspection  We gave them a huge pot of money the congressional staffer said We thought we had a good plan  San Diego emergency responders revive a woman who overdosed outside her San Diego apartment on Nov 11 Salwan GeorgesThe   The rising toll  After Byrne had responded to 100 fatal overdoses in San Diego the pace suddenly picked up Less than a year later he was at his 200th death scene Fentanyl was killing people in the most private and intimate of places  in their bedrooms their bathrooms in the hallways of their homes  One of Byrnes problems was that no one else wanted to test for fentanyl at crime scenes In the early stages of the crisis much of the DEA messaging had been geared toward alerting first responders to the dangers of fentanyl They became so terrified that they would call in hazmat crews if they thought fentanyl was present  But Byrne saw the downside to the scary messaging Fentanyl is only a significant threat if the powder is dispersed into the air and inhaled Touching the pills or handling bags of powder is not a mortal risk because the drug isnt easily absorbed through the skin Pharmaceutical fentanyl patches prescribed to manage intense pain use a chemical agent to allow the drug to be absorbed  Fentanyls reputation made it hard for Byrne to get fellow officers and agents to do their own testing So they would call him and hed arrive in his Ford Explorer In the back he kept two MX908 mass spectrometers He once found the crumbs of a pill under a dead teenagers keyboard The boys father hit the space bar and when the monitor lit up the boys message exchanges with the dealer popped up on the screen  Byrne and Impellizeri leave the scene of a fatal overdose in San Diego on Nov 10 Salwan GeorgesThe   Sending samples to a lab that took weeks to process the results meant the loss of crucial time for investigative leads And when a hot or superpotent supply was ravaging users in rapid succession it was important to know right away that an especially lethal batch of fentanyl had hit the streets  By 2019 fentanyl deaths in San Diego had risen 787 percent in five years  Just when we think it cant get any worse the latest numbers prove us wrong US Attorney Robert Brewer said at a news conference that July  That summer Byrne responded to a call at an extendedstay motel in San Diegos Clairemont Mesa district A 30yearold parolee named Major Williams whom police had identified as a gang member was found dead in his room The cause of death fentanyl cocaine and alcohol  Less than two years later

20162020  While the growing threats posed by fire have been explored in detail particularly for populations in the most fireprone regions the risks that smoke pollution pose have been stymied by lack of precise data until now  People may be less likely to notice days with a modest increase in fine particulate matter from smoke but those days can still have an impact on peoples health said Marissa Childs who led the research while getting her PhD from Stanford She also noted that the most extreme smoke days were rarely seen between 2006 to 2010 But in the more recent study years from 2016 to 2020 she said the research shows that more than 15 million people particularly in the Western United States were routinely exposed to levels that carry immediate risks  Annual average PM25 from smoke

Environment and School of Public Health had originally intended to focus on the health effects of firerelated air pollution When we started we realized there were a lot of questions about how smoke affected peoples health that we didnt have answers to she said including basic questions around estimated mortality from smoke fine particulate matter and how the health effects of smoke compare with other sources of pollution  Filling in that gap was a long and arduous process The analysis began with satellite data to map the geographic spread of particulate matter from above and incorporated groundlevel monitors to measure pollution where it matters most to human health The research isolated wildfire smoke from background pollution from other sources which has actually decreased in recent decades  We have been remarkably successful in cleaning up other sources of air pollution across the country mainly due to regulation like the Clean Air Act said Marshall Burke a coauthor of the research and professor of earth system science at Stanford That success especially in the West has really stagnated And in recent years this started to reverse  The research indicates that wildfire smoke could be a leading cause of that reversal wiping out most of the progress Some areas in the Western United States had increases in particulate pollution from smoke that were about the same amount as the improvements in air quality from regulating factories and other point source pollution As climate change intensifies fire risk across the country and smoke plumes can travel thousands of miles from their source no one is safe from the effects  Particulate pollution causes more than shortterm irritation It has been linked to chronic heart and lung conditions as well other negative health effects like cognitive decline depression and premature birth But more work remains to be done on pollution specifically from wildfires  There is no safe concentration said Tarik Benmarhnia an environmental epidemiologist at the University of California San Diego who contributed to an earlier study on hospitalizations showing that smoke from wildfires can be 10 times more harmful than other sources of air pollution  And yet much of the existing research sees wildfires as something rare exceptional and intense according to Dr Benmarhnia But in a changing climate he sees the health impacts of chronic exposure to wildfire smoke as one of the biggest unknowns  Subsequent research with this data will have important policy implications both for local governments at the source of wildfires and for wider populations affected by smoke  One solution experts say is to reduce the potential for wildfires to grow into longlasting and destructive infernos In recent years California has recognized that decades of fire suppression have led to a buildup of fuel in forests where smaller contained fires actually contribute to the health of the forest The state has been increasing prescribed fires and other forest management techniques to help reduce the risk of outofcontrol megafires  The new research indicates that the health risk is rising as the hot and dry conditions for wildfires continue to worsen with climate change  And existing warning systems wont be enough in the future We cant just ask people to stay inside half the year said Dr Benmarhnia At the end of the day the best type of policy is to proactively prevent these big fires in the first place', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",
       " {'guid': 4270, 'text_a': 'Twitter suspended the accounts of several highprofile journalists on Thursday night many of whom have been reporting on Elon Musks controversial takeover of the company After facing backlash Musk decided to reinstate most  but not all  of the suspended accounts by the following day  While the journalists were given no initial explanation for their suspension Musk argued soon after that journalists he suspended were doxxing him  or revealing his personal information online  by linking to a website called ElonJet that tracked the whereabouts of Musks plane using publicly available flight data  The journalists who were suspended include Donie OSullivan from CNN Drew Harwell of the Washington Post Ryan Mac of the New York Times Matt Binder of Mashable and Micah Lee of The Intercept The sudden purging seems to contradict Musks stated commitment to protecting freedom of speech on Twitter and sparked concern that Musk could be using his power at Twitter to silence reporters who write critically about the company On Friday Twitter also suspended the account of Linette Lopez a journalist for Business Insider who has written investigative reports about Tesla  Twitter reinstated the accounts of most of the previously banned journalists on Friday evening The move came after Musk received publish backlash from the United Nations US lawmakers media outlets and other groups concerned that Musk was stifling press freedom  Leading up the decision to reinstate the journalists Musk also ran two polls on his Twitter in which a majority of people voted to reinstate the journalists accounts immediately The people have spoken Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now tweeted Muskon Friday evening But two journalists who were suspended in Musks recent crackdown Business Insiders Lopez and Keith Olbermann still remained suspended as of Saturday morning  For independent journalist and former  reporter Aaron Rupar being suspended from Twitter was a shock  I was very baffled I thought people were trolling said Rupar recounting when he started getting messages from other journalists telling him hed been suspended Overnight Rupar lost access to his 790000 followers He said he received no warning before being booted You basically have to comply with the whims that change day by day of the owner of the platform that seems pretty unsustainable It almost seems kind of spiteful  Several of the journalists who have been suspended including Rupar had recently posted about the debate over ElonJet  a Twitter account that tracked the whereabouts of Musks private aircraft using publicly available flight data Musk has argued that the account was jeopardizing his physical safety and changed Twitters rules to ban the sharing of live location information in order to suspend the account Musk tweeted that the accounts posted his exact realtime location basically assassination coordinates ElonJets 20yearold account owner Jack Sweeney has argued that the information about Elon Musks jets is already public If someone wanted to do something they could do it without me he told the New York Times Some journalists such as Rupar had recently tweeted out links to ElonJets alternate Facebook account  Musk recently tweeted that a crazy stalker followed a car carrying his young child X and jumped onto its hood Musk said he is taking legal action against the owner of the ElonJet account for allegedly jeopardizing his familys safety The Los Angeles Police Department told press on Thursday that no police reports had been filed yet about the alleged incident  A few hours after reporters were suspended several of them joined a live audio conversation using Twitters Spaces feature to discuss what was happening At its peak more than 30000 people listened in as Musk briefly joined the conversation In the Spaces Musk debated with journalists arguing that posting a link to the flight tracking website was the same as directly posting his address and he considers it doxxing  Theres not going to be any distinction in the future between socalled journalists and regular people Musk said You doxx you get suspended End of story  I never posted your address the Washington Posts Harwell told Musk  Musk interjected You posted a link to my address  Harwell replied We posted a link  in the course of reporting about ElonJet we posted links to ElonJet which are now not online and now banned on Twitter  Soon after the exchange Musk left the Spaces and Twitter suspended the Spaces feature altogether reportedly cutting off the journalists chat Musk later tweeted Were fixing a Legacy bug Should be working tomorrow  While some of the deplatformed journalists were initially told that their suspension was permanent Musk later said that suspensions for doxxing would be temporary  a 7day automatic suspension for anyone who doxxes Musk also ran a poll on his Twitter account asking how long he should wait before reinstating the journalists When a majority of people voted to reinstate the journalists immediately Musk ran another poll with fewer options Nearly 60 percent of respondents again voted to reinstate the journalists immediately  Many journalists on Thursday night expressed concern about Twitters decisions The move could prompt more reporters or the media outlets they work for to leave Twitter and try using alternate platforms such as Mastodon Discord and Post  Its very shady said Washington Post tech columnist Taylor Lorenz who said her account hasnt been suspended in this wave despite worries from some of her followers that it might have been I dont understand how news organizations are going to continue to use this platform if they are censoring journalists  CNN and the New York Times both sent statements to Recode condemning Twitters suspension of their reporters accounts and said they are asking the company for an explanation  The impulsive and unjustified suspension of a number of reporters including CNNs Donie OSullivan is concerning but not surprising said a spokesperson from CNN in an emailed statement Twitters increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses Twitter We have asked Twitter for an explanation and we will reevaluate our relationship based on that response  Tonights suspension of the Twitter accounts of a number of prominent journalists including The New York Timess Ryan Mac is questionable and unfortunate Neither The Times nor Ryan have received any explanation about why this occurred said a spokesperson for the New York Times in a written statement We hope that all of the journalists accounts are reinstated and that Twitter provides a satisfying explanation for this action  The move angered politicians too Rep Lori Trahan DMA tweeted that Twitter staff promised her earlier on Thursday morning that the the company wouldnt retaliate against journalists or academics who criticize the company Less than 12 hours later multiple technology reporters have been suspended Whats the deal elonmusk the lawmaker wrote  In Europe EU commissioner Vera Jourova said that Musks suspension violated the EUs Digital Services Act and its Media Freedom Act There are red lines And sanctions soon she tweeted Friday morning  Meanwhile the journalists who were suspended are still waiting for news about exactly when their accounts might be reactivated  Rupar said he tried to appeal his Twitter suspension using the platforms automated system for doing so but the link was broken  I think it is a cautionary lesson here for outlets and individual journalists Its good to diversify to other platforms he said The Twitter purge will have a chilling effect on anyone criticizing Elon

proceedings which are ongoing As Bloomberg recently reported At least 73 million of political donations tied to Sam BankmanFrieds FTX may be at risk of being clawed back That figure seems to include all of his personal giving along with what came from his super PAC as well as contributions from his top lieutenants to Republicans more on that in a moment  Advertisement  Advertisement  Politicians should be setting aside money with the expectation that donations from Sam BankmanFried will be clawed back in bankruptcy court  Some Democrats have already realized the liability that these donations present and have started a giving spree of their own Sen Debbie Stabenow a Michigan Democrat who received all told 26600 from BankmanFried said she plans to donate the money to a local charity Congressmanelect Maxwell Frost weeks away from officially being sworn in as the youngest member of the House just announced that he would also be donating the BankmanFried money he received to charity Many of the aforementioned Dems including Jeffries Aguilar Gillibrand and Torres have donated or said they intend to do so too  Advertisement  But not all Democrats are whistling the same tune In a recent interview Rep Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts refused the idea of turning over the money he got from BankmanFried Auchincloss was 1 of 8 members of Congress to sign a letter in March calling for the SEC to back off its investigation into crypto firms including FTX Im not going to send money to a guy sitting in a Bahamian jail he said in the recent interview That money is out the door  Advertisement  Hes right that much of the money BankmanFried gave to politicians has already been spent  Many Democrats are now stuck between some ugly options Give up the equivalent amount of money via charitable donation wait for it to be clawed back in bankruptcy court or wait for it to be identified as stolen by the federal government And while paying back several thousand dollars in donations is not a huge financial burden for senior Dems like Jeffries or Aguilar the much larger donations to the DCCC DSCC and other campaign arms make the whole situation much more treacherousand awkward  Giving the money away doesnt make the problems go away with it Campaign finance attorney Brett Kappel recently warned in an Associated Press report that those politicians should be setting the money aside with the expectation that it will have to be sent back in bankruptcy court The Federal Election Commission requires political campaigns and committees to return donations found to have been made illegally even if new money has to be raised to facilitate that reimbursement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  In fact its possible that the incoming DCCC and DSCC chairs yet to be chosen will have to raise money not to kick off the 2024 campaign cycle but to pay down those numbers and help get the BankmanFried donations off the books Exceedingly few Democrats have been willing to put themselves up for those two jobs for this upcoming cycle even without the BankmanFried headache they have become widely understood as the worst jobs in Washington Now they look that much worse  Are Republicans in the clear Absolutely not FTXs coCEO Ryan Salame gave 25 million to Republicans and FTXs top brass routed money to Sen Mitch McConnell and Rep Kevin McCarthy as well as 35 million to the GOPs Senate Leadership Fund super PAC BankmanFried has claimed that he gave just as much in dark money to the GOP as he did in registered giving to Democrats The details of that dark money still havent come to light But its very likely Republicans will find themselves in a similar position Sen John Hoeven a North Dakota Republican has already announced that he gave 11600money received from BankmanFried and Salameto the Salvation Army  Advertisement  Back on the blue side of the aisle critics have rightly said that the party courted this disaster by embracing the lavish spending of an overnight billionaire Just a few weeks after Election Day the decision to accept BankmanFrieds involvement in Democratic campaigns has become a political liabilityfueling various conspiracy theoriesas well as a financial one At best it was a massive tactical gaffe  Dont forget that BankmanFried aside from his personal donations to candidates left Democrats high and dry in the general election after pledging to spend exorbitantly They got almost no advantage from his support once November rolled around The obvious move from here would be to enact higher institutional barriers for billionaire involvement and super PAC spending in the Democratic political process  Still even Democrats who have disavowed or donated the BankmanFried money still benefited from it during election season some members of the freshman class might not be in Washington without the help of his machine Its an ugly and expensive start for a new class and new leadership regime The bankruptcy and criminal proceedings meanwhile have only just begun', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

the southern border according to internal federal figures obtained by   The tally surpassed the 122000 unaccompanied minors that federal shelters received in fiscal year 2021 when the Biden administration found itself unprepared for a sudden sharp increase in child migration that led to severe overcrowding in border facilities the Department of Health and Human Services HHS data show  It also eclipsed the number of migrant children transferred to HHS in 2014 and 2019 when the Obama and Trump administrations struggled to process what at the time were historic numbers of unaccompanied minors entering US border custody  Under law HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement is charged with housing unaccompanied children who lack a legal immigration status until they turn 18 or can be released to a sponsor who is typically a parent or another close relative living in the US Historically the vast majority of minors received by the agency are migrant teenagers who crossed the USMexico border without their parents or legal guardians  The record number of unaccompanied minors processed by federal immigration officials over the past 12 months is part of a broader unprecedented influx of migrants along the southern border that has created dire humanitarian operational and political challenges for President Bidens administration  Federal officials along the USMexico border processed migrants over 2 million times in fiscal year 2022 the highest level recorded by US Customs and Border Protection Roughly a quarter of all migrant apprehensions involved repeat crossings by the same individuals the CBP data shows  This picture taken on October 9 2022 shows a young boy sitting on the floor as migrants wait to be processed by US Border Patrol after they illegally crossed the US southern border with Mexico on October 9 2022 in Eagle Pass Texas ALLISON DINNERAFP via Getty Images  Like the broader recent increase in illegal migration the record arrivals of unaccompanied children along the southern border can be partly attributed to poverty domestic and gang violence and other deteriorating conditions in Central America where the vast majority of these minors hail from migration analysts said  A desire to reunite with family members in the US has for years been a major factor driving child migration to the southern border According to government estimates approximately 80 of the Central American unaccompanied children who enter federal custody have relatives in the US who can sponsor them  Migrant smugglers in the region and migrants who successfully enter the US have also relayed to Central American families and teenagers in poor and workingclass communities that unaccompanied minors are virtually guaranteed an opportunity to stay in the US after crossing the southern border  Absent policy changes were likely to see a large number of unaccompanied minors for the foreseeable future said Andrew Selee president of the Migration Policy Institute a nonpartisan think tank Given the conditions in Central America it makes sense for young people to try and make it to the US to help their families or for families that are already here to bring their children  While US border officials have several legal authorities to quickly deport adults  and even families traveling with children  who enter the country unlawfully a Bushera law designed to protect minors from trafficking bars the quick deportation of unaccompanied youth who are not from Mexico It also requires they be transferred to HHS while their immigration court cases are reviewed a process that typically takes years to complete  The Trump administration suspended this process in 2020 using a coronavirusera public health order known as Title 42 to rapidly expel more than 15000 unaccompanied migrant children from the US But the Biden administration exempted unaccompanied minors from Title 42 on humanitarian grounds  Children part of a group of more than 50 asylum seekers

law Others traveled to the US with parents but were separated from them for different reasons including concerns they would be sent back to Mexico if they crossed together  Francisco 15 Carlos 13 and

New York City government documents reviewed by  show  Doris their mother said she fled Honduras with her children after receiving death threats from her eldest daughters estranged and abusive husband She said they journeyed north together but became separated in northern Mexico after being chased by Mexican officials  I told them run forward Doris recounted in Spanish saying Mexican officials tried to prevent her family from crossing into the US It was very difficult for me to be separated from my children  Francisco said he helped his younger brothers cross into the US where Border Patrol processed the siblings as unaccompanied minors before transferring them to HHS which placed them in shelters in Florida and New York  is not disclosing their surnames because they are minors  When they swam across the Rio Grande it was Franciscos responsibility to care for Diego the youngest brother I was not thinking about myself I was thinking about the kid because he did not have a jacket and it was at night Francisco said in Spanish  Doris poses for a photo alongside her sons Francisco Carlos and Diego The family from Honduras is now living in a shelter in New York City   Doris meanwhile said she tried to cross into the US multiple times to reunite with her sons but was repeatedly expelled to Mexico She said she felt dead while waiting months in Mexico without her children  It wasnt until this June that Doris said she was granted a humanitarian exemption to Title 42 and allowed to enter the US after connecting with Each Step Home a USbased group that helps migrant children in US custody reunite with their families  But even after Doris entered the US it took months for HHS to release her children because she was living in a shelter for homeless adults and did not have a permanent address I almost had a heart attack she said describing the moment she reunited with her sons last month  The family is now living in a room inside a Brooklyn shelter housing other migrant families Despite the small living space Doris said her sons are happy to be with her She was able to enroll Francisco and Carlos in a local public school where they are learning English  I want to study and be able to work one day Francisco said  But Doris said its been difficult to find a job since she does not have a work permit Her hearing in immigration court where she can ask for asylum to try to block her deportation is scheduled for March 2023  In a statement to  the Office of Refugee Resettlement confirmed it received a record number of unaccompanied children in fiscal year 2022 The agency said it was working to set up new shelters and add beds at 220 existing housing facilities to accommodate additional border arrivals of migrant children  ORR continues to build capacity that enhances our ability to accept referrals from the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner by expanding bed capacity minimizing the amount of time children stay in congregate care settings and safely placing children with vetted sponsors the agency added  While the number of unaccompanied children received by HHS in fiscal year 2022 reached an alltime high the Biden administration did not face the same level of operational and humanitarian setbacks processing these minors as last year  In the spring of 2021 thousands of unaccompanied children became stranded in overcrowded Border Patrol tents and detention facilities because HHS did not have enough bed space in its shelter system to house them  To reduce overcrowding at border facilities HHS set up more than a dozen makeshift shelters at military sites convention centers and work camps While conditions varied across the emergency facilities children housed at some of the sites reported substandard services as well as mental health concerns and prolonged stays  Over the past year however HHS closed most of its emergency sites and improved conditions at the ones that remain operational It also dramatically expedited releases of children to sponsors including by eliminating some steps in the sponsorship process and hiring additional case managers to place minors with sponsors  Migrant children are currently spending an average of 29 days in HHS care down from 37 days in fiscal year 2021 federal statistics show  At one point in the spring of 2021 HHS was caring for more than 22000 unaccompanied minors a record high As of Thursday the agency was housing fewer than 10000 unaccompanied minors according to government data', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

       " {'guid': 5195, 'text_a': 'We have now lived with the consequences of Ruth Bader Ginsburgs latelife arrogance for more than two years  In 2014 President Barack Obama was in office and Democrats controlled the Senate empowering them to confirm a new justice if Justice Ginsburg had left the Supreme Court Ginsburg was a twotime cancer survivor in her 80s the oldest member of a 54 Court where the right to an abortion  and perhaps even the right to vote in reasonably fair elections  teetered on a knifes edge  When she died in the final months of the Trump presidency Ginsburg told her granddaughters her last desire My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed It amounted to nothing Ruth Bader Ginsburgs seat on the Supreme Court a seat that until recently belonged to the greatest womens rights lawyer in American history is now held by her ideological opposite  Now eight years later the question arises Should Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan 68 and 62 respectively do what Ginsburg would not  Both justices are much younger than Ginsburg was in 2014 There are no reports that either is in ill health although Sotomayor has diabetes shes managed that condition nearly her entire life Realistically both justices could probably look forward to a decade or more of judicial service if they desire it But even a mighty Supreme Court justice cannot overcome the merciless math facing Democrats in a malapportioned Senate that effectively gives extra representation to Republicans in small states  Barring extraordinary events Democrats will control the White House and the Senate for the next two years They are unlikely to control it for longer than that The 2024 Senate map is so brutal for Democrats that they would likely need to win a landslide in the national popular vote just to break even Unless they stanch the damage then some forecasts suggest that Democrats wont have a realistic shot at a Senate majority until 2030 or 2032 And even those forecasts may be too optimistic for Democrats  If Sotomayor and Kagan do not retire within the next two years in other words they could doom the entire country to live under a 72 or even an 81 Court controlled by an increasingly radicalized Republican Partys appointees  Senate Republicans have made it perfectly clear that they view Supreme Court seats as a political prize that goes to the party that controls both the White House and the Senate In 2016 when Justice Antonin Scalias death created a Supreme Court vacancy during Obamas final year in office Republicans invented a new rule claiming that a vacancy that opens in an election year should be filled by the next president They abandoned that madeup rule as soon as it was inconvenient for them racing to confirm Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett the week before voters cast Trump out of office  Meanwhile the Senate is malapportioned to give extra representation to residents of smaller states dominated by Republicans In the current 5050 Senate Democratic senators represent nearly 42 million more people than their Republican counterparts Democrats have a 2921 seat majority in the 25 most populous states  states that contain nearly 84 percent of the 50 states population  while Republicans have an identical 2921 seat majority in the remaining states  Yet there are good reasons for Democrats to worry about a future where Republican justices get to serve for decades while their Democratic counterparts have to rotate out every time it is possible to replace them with another Democrat Longserving justices can develop cult followings that expand their legal and political influence far beyond their one vote much like Ginsburg did in life and as Justice Clarence Thomas has done among the legal right And justices who serve for a very long time also develop relationships with their colleagues that they can sometimes use to encourage those colleagues to moderate  If only Republican justices can benefit from longevity the Courts right flank will gain yet another structural advantage over its left  But at some point the advantages of longevity and experience must yield not just to the Senates unforgiving math but to the mathematics of the Court itself In the Supreme Court the only number that truly matters is five It takes five justices to make a majority that can do literally anything they want to US law  And if Republican appointees capture seven or eight seats on the Supreme Court it will become effortless for the GOP to find five votes for truly outlandish legal outcomes  Sotomayor and Kagan will have to look at these risks and counterrisks and make their own calculations  but for the sake of the nation they serve they cannot simply ignore the very realistic chance that the next two years may give them their only remaining opportunity to leave their seat to someone who shares their liberal democratic values  Each additional Republicancontrolled seat on the Supreme Court endangers more fundamental rights  It is difficult to predict which issues will come before the Court in the coming years in part because the Court tends to hear more cases brought by conservative activists as its membership moves rightward In a world where Sotomayor or Kagan is replaced by a Republican president the Court could hear even more cases attacking the right to vote It could impose increasingly heavy shackles on Democratic administrations And it may even strip away more constitutional rights as it already did with the right to an abortion  The size of the GOP majority on the Court matters because not every Republicanappointed justice is like Samuel Alito an almost unrelenting partisan who will reliably advocate for the GOPs preferred outcome even when he has to make weak legal arguments in order to do so Most justices do approach the law in ways that occasionally disappoint activists within their own political party even if they dont do so very often  Indeed the divide within the Courts GOPappointed majority was on full display in what may be the most highprofile case of the past halfcentury Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization 2022 the Supreme Courts decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion That decision produced two competing concurring opinions both of which point to radically different futures for Americans personal and sexual autonomy  Justice Thomas for his part labeled decisions protecting the right to contraception the right to samesex marriage and the right of consenting adults to engage in sexual activity as demonstrably erroneous And he claimed that his Court should reconsider whether it should continue to protect these rights  Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a separate opinion where he seemed to disclaim any interest in Thomass project Pointing to many of the same cases that Thomas threatened to toss out Kavanaugh wrote that overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents  In part because no other justice joined either Thomass or Kavanaughs Dobbs concurrence it is difficult to pin down where every member of the Court falls between them but at least some of the Courts Republican appointees have signaled that they share at least some of Thomass desire to tear away existing rights  Alitos dissent in Obergefell v Hodges 2015 the marriage equality decision tracks the reasoning of his majority opinion in Dobbs so closely that its hard to imagine that he would not vote to overrule Obergefell if given the chance Similarly Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the Courts decision in Pavan v Smith 2017 which rejected an attempt to water down Obergefells holding that samesex couples are entitled to marry on the same terms and conditions as oppositesex couples  Barrett meanwhile has largely played her cards close to her chest since joining the Court But as a law professor she signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops endorsing the churchs antiLGBTQ position on marriage and family founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman  Realistically in other words there are almost certainly at least two votes  and potentially as many as four votes  on the current Court to overrule Obergefell That means that the constitutional right to marry whoever you choose could be in danger if Republicans gain just one more seat on the Court  Even more troublingly the Supreme Court has spent the past several years concentrating power within itself It invented a legal doctrine known as major questions for example which is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution or in any statute and which in effect enables the Court to veto any federal regulation that five justices dislike That means that a Court with five justices from the GOPs far right wing could tear through the Code of Federal Regulation even if relatively restrained justices like Kavanaugh or Barrett vote to keep it mostly intact  Similarly at Decembers oral arguments in Moore v Harper a majority of the Court seemed likely to give itself the power to overrule a state supreme courts interpretation of the states own election law at least in outrageous cases when five justices believe that the state mangled its own interpretation of its law But the question of what constitutes an outrageous case will have to be determined by each justice and several members of the Court have already signaled that they would set the bar very low  On the current Court the sixjustice Republican majority has largely split into two factions Thomas Alito and Gorsuch make up a deeply reactionary bloc who demand avulsive changes to the law on the fastest possible timeline  Meanwhile Chief Justice John Roberts Kavanaugh and Barrett make up a faction that favors most of the same policy outcomes pushed by the Alito bloc but with some significant exceptions Kavanaugh for example wanted no part of an opinion Alito wrote that in Kavanaughs words would insert the judiciary into the Navys chain of command overriding military commanders professional military judgments This middle bloc of justices also tends to move more incrementally sometimes pushing to achieve the conservative movements preferred outcomes over a timeline of years rather than a few months  But there are good reasons to fear that future Republican appointees to the Supreme Court will look more like Thomas and Alito than like Roberts or Kavanaugh One is that Trump largely had to look to judges appointed by President George W Bush to find candidates for the Supreme Court and the median Bush judge was much more moderate than the typical Trump judge The next Republican president by contrast will have a wide array of deeply reactionary Trump appointees to choose from  judges like Neomi Rao Andrew Oldham or James Ho who make Brett Kavanaugh look like Bernie Sanders  In a world with seven or eight Republican Supreme Court justices in other words the Court will likely intrude into more and more areas of American life where it has no expertise and no lawful mandate to do so It will dismantle rights that millions of Americans depend on And it is likely to manipulate the electoral system to keep the Courts ideological allies in elected office  The price of early retirements  If Sotomayor or Kagan were to die under a Republican president  or given how Senate Republicans treated moderate Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland if Sotomayor or Kagan were to die under a Democratic president and a Republican Senate  it is very unlikely that either could be replaced by a likeminded justice Indeed the Garland precedent suggests that Republicans might simply hold the seat open for as long as it took to fill it with an extremist like Gorsuch  That could be catastrophic for liberal democracy in the United States But there are also two reasons to hesitate before calling for every Democratic appointee to the Supreme Court to rotate off the Court the minute they can be replaced by a younger Democrat  Relationships matter  One is the simple fact that relationships matter within an institution made up of only nine people Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedys retirement drove the Court to the right in 2018 Justice Kagan told journalist Dahlia Lithwick of her plans to keep her colleagues from doing too much damage to the law  The trick Kagan said is to take big questions and make them small Find ways to dispose of cases on narrow procedural grounds or to dismiss them for lack of jurisdiction If that wont work try to find five votes to hand down a narrow substantive rule that will have little impact on future cases  Kagan also named the Republican appointee that she thought was most likely to be open to her appeals Im a huge fan of the Chief Justice she said referring to Roberts She added that I think he cares deeply about the institution and its legitimacy  For a while before Ginsburgs death gave Republican appointees a supermajority and rendered Robertss vote irrelevant in the biggest cases Kagans strategy seemed to work In the Courts 201920 term  its last full term with Ginsburg  the Court handed down a string of narrowly decided liberal victories  Roberts cast a surprising vote to preserve abortion rights for example largely because the issue before the Court in June Medical Services v Russo 2020 was identical to the one before the Court in a previous decision supporting abortion rights The Court also kept the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program an immigration program created by President Obama alive by pointing to a paperwork error by the Trump administration  Indeed Kagan appeared to be so successful in leveraging her relationship with the chief that the conservative Wall Street Journals editorial board mockingly labeled her Chief Justice Elena Kagan and disparaged what it labeled the Kagan Court  If Thomas or Alito both of whom are in their 70s leaves the Court in the next two years then President Biden would likely replace them with a liberal justice and Roberts would become the Courts pivotal vote once again Should that happen Democrats may regret what happens next if Justice Kagan is no longer around to persuade the chief to seek moderation  Longserving justices can build a movement  For most of his time on the Supreme Court Justice Thomas was largely ignored by his colleagues  and for good reason He has a penchant for opinions claiming that foundational legal principles should simply be tossed out  Thomass concurring opinion in United States v Lopez 1995 for example closely tracks the reasoning the Supreme Court used in an infamous 1918 decision striking down federal child labor laws Hes repeatedly called for the Court to strip millions of Americans of their free speech rights  including a 2019 opinion calling on his Court to overrule a seminal precedent ensuring that freedom of the press continues to exist  while simultaneously reading the First Amendment expansively to protect wealthy political donors Hes also claimed that state governments should be allowed to establish an official state church  Yet while Thomas spent more than two decades writing lonely nutty opinions that his fellow justices rarely joined he slowly became the most consequential legal thinker in the United States largely because of the way that students are educated in law schools  A year before his death Justice Antonin Scalia explained why he so often wrote punchy unforgettable opinions where he might dismiss an opponents argument as pure applesauce or arglebargle Ive given up on the current generation  theyre gone forget about them Scalia said in 2015 But the kids in law school I think theres still a chance he added Thats who I write my dissents for  Law school textbooks are often referred to as casebooks because they largely compile canonical or anticanonical court decisions including both majority opinions and dissents Classroom instruction frequently involves a debate over the relative merits of these majority and dissenting views What Scalia understood is that if he wrote engaging and memorable dissents generations of law students would read them while they were forming their opinions about the law And someday some of those students would become judges  or even justices with the power to turn Scalias dissents into majority opinions  But it was Thomas not Scalia who perfected this strategy Liberal law students read Thomass opinions and often wondered how anyone could possibly agree with him But the most reactionary aspiring lawyers read them and saw a visionary At a time when most judicial conservatives still emphasized judicial restraint Thomas called for the courts to do more Strike down more laws Cast aside celebrated precedents Place a yoke around the neck of the law and force it to labor for the conservative movement  And Thomass bold activist vision for the courts is now the dominant vision within the Republican Party This vision drives everything from the seemingly endless barrage of lawsuits targeting Obamacare to the Courts decision to give itself a veto power over the entire US administrative state More than one in eight of Trumps appointees to the federal appellate bench were Thomas clerks A 2018 Associated Press report found that 22 former Thomas clerks either hold political appointments in the Trump administration or have been nominated to judgeships by Trump  Thomass growing popularity among legal conservatives is also a second reason to fear that the next Republican presidents Supreme Court appointments could be more reactionary than Trumps  But Thomass tremendous influence on the conservative legal movements ambitions were not apparent until his third decade on the Court It takes time to build a movement out of the handful of law students in every constitutional law class who read Thomass opinions and said to themselves Why not  This kind of sustained movementbuilding around a central leader simply is not possible if that leader has to quit their job right when they are starting to master it It is impossible to know now whether Sotomayor or Kagan will 20 years from now be seen as a visionary who ushered in a new era of liberalism in much the same way that Thomas built a movement for reactionary judicial supremacy But that certainly wont happen if they leave the Court prematurely  So what should Sotomayor and Kagan do  The good news for Obamas two appointees to the Supreme Court is that they do not need to decide whether to retire today Barring unlikely events such as the death of two Democratic senators in states with Republican governors Democrats will control the White House and the Senate for the next two years Thats two entire years when they can also confirm Supreme Court justices if a vacancy arises on the Court  Realistically however Democrats need to win a crushing victory in 2024 to even have a chance at holding on to the Senate Democrats need to defend incumbents in the solidly red states of Montana West Virginia and Ohio They also need to figure out what to do about Sen Kyrsten Sinema IAZ an Arizona incumbent with a bathyspheric approval rating that could preclude her winning reelection  but whose recent decision to quit the Democratic Party allows her to run as a spoiler candidate who could throw Arizonas next Senate race to the Republican  It is certainly possible that President Biden  like another president who struggled with skyhigh inflation during his early presidency then cruised to reelection as the economy improved  could win reelection by such a commanding margin that Republican Senate candidates will be at a disadvantage in 2024  Barring a Democratic landslide however the partys opportunity to fill a Supreme Court seat will likely come to an end in 2025  Nor is the Democratic Partys misery in the Senate likely to solve itself anytime soon As Stanford political scientist Jonathan Rodden explains as you go from the center of cities out through the suburbs and into rural areas you traverse in a linear fashion from Democratic to Republican places So long as this urbanrural divide exists Republicans are strongly favored to control the Senate because of their dominance in lowpopulation states  So Sotomayor

loss of the House has created an investigative vacuum that party senators intend to fill said Sen Richard Blumenthal DConn an investigativeminded former prosecutor and senior Judiciary Committee member  There are very definitely investigations that I think now will be possible Blumenthal said referring to Democrats inability to issue subpoenas in the current 5050 Senate because Republicans could block them at the evenly divided committee level  Democrats Senate pickup is welcome news for a party that had agonized over how to push back on a spate of planned House GOP investigations into everything from the presidents son to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to the FBI and Justice Department For the moment President Joe Bidens party is brushing off Republican efforts Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated last week that oversight isnt just about the executive branch but also the private sector  A senator set to lead that sort of privatesector oversight  Bernie Sanders IVt incoming chair of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee  said it was premature to discuss subpoenas but outlined a laundry list of areas he plans to investigate next year  Were talking about incredible greed in the pharmaceutical industry very high prices Were paying the highest prices in the world for healthcare were talking about union busting  I think those are issues the American people want us to look at he said  But that doesnt mean Senate Democrats are going to immediately start firing off subpoenas Its 5149 majority has given the party more power but that authority remains fragile  a fact underscored by Arizona Sen Kyrsten Sinemas decision to become an independent Sinema is expected to keep her committee assignments importantly with Democrats and Schumer seeking to tamp down the ramifications for their majority by vowing that Democrats would still be able to exercise our subpoena power  However theyll have to carefully navigate aggressive investigations for another reason a difficult 2024 Senate map Several of their seats in red and purple territory are up next term where partisan probes may not pay political dividends  Among those up for reelection besides Sinema are Sens Joe Manchin DWVa Jon Tester DMont and Sherrod Brown DOhio who chair the energy veterans affairs and banking committees respectively And all hail from states that voted for Trump in 2020 two by overwhelming margins  Brown shrugged off a question about new investigative priorities once he gets boosted committee powers Nothing jumps to mind but perhaps  Despite past intraparty criticism of the Biden administration from a rule to decrease methane emissions to the botched pullout from Afghanistan Democrats are less than keen on conducting oversight on the current head of the executive branch Sen Sheldon Whitehouse DRI who is poised to chair the Budget Committee said he wouldnt be surprised if there were members within the conference who thought that anything negative about the administration was kryptonite  But Democrats are already leaving a trail of bread crumbs pointing to what they could dig into next year likely picking up longawaited threads that the 5050 Senate has prevented them from pursuing  Sen Ron Wyden DOre the chair of the Finance Committee and outgoing House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney DNY are asking for records related to Trumpsoninlaw Jared Kushners family business And in line with Schumers corporate focus Wyden sent a letter last week to Amgen a biotech company as part of a probe into pharmaceutical companies compliance with tax laws  Wyden pointed to the Kushnerrelated effort as a sign that Democrats believe in strong oversight and signaled that hes also interested in Trumps tax returns But he sidestepped committing to using subpoenas next year  All the options are on the table Wyden said But as my wife always says you know theres some history here I wrote the first Trumprelated tax bill  Whitehouse one of the caucus most outspoken voices on climate change pointed to Rep Ro Khannas DCalif investigation into whether fossilfuel companies had been misleading and spreading misinformation on the impact of climate change as an example of an area Senate Democrats could take over next year  I think it can be quite busy and quite productive Whitehouse said about the forthcoming Democratic investigations  Judiciary Committee Democrats have also signaled an interest in investigating decisions made by the Trumpera DOJ Theyve previously signaled that they wanted to talk to former Attorneys

at least one clear preference from many Democratic leaders both outside and inside these party deliberations that Iowa be scrapped from its coveted first slot  I dont think theres any way Iowa stays and theres no reason for Iowa to stay said one Democrat familiar with the process of the DNCs Rules and Bylaws Committee the group charged with reordering the calendar From an electoral standpoint

nominating calendar at the meeting according to sources familiar with the agenda which will then go before the full DNC for a vote in late January or early February  But there is frustration among some DNC members about the silence from the White House  If the president says he wants this state or that state in the early window then Im going to support it because hes the leader of the party and

money into this whole process and the White House has given us nothing even though were only days away from making a decision  Its almost like Kabuki theater the person continued  Some of the outstanding questions facing the DNC were reshaped by Novembers midterm results  One is which state would replace Iowa representing the Midwestern region in the earlystate lineup Both Michigan and Minnesota are seen as leading contenders for the slot positions that were further strengthened by the November results Democrats flipped both of Michigans state legislative chambers and reelected Gov Gretchen Whitmer while Democrats in Minnesota also gained trifecta control there by flipping the state Senate and reelecting Gov Tim Walz  Those victories clear the way for both states to legislatively change the date of their primaries removing logistical hurdles they would have faced without those results Walz along with other state leaders sent a letter to DNC members this month confirming his state partys commitment to pass such legislation arguing that Minnesota is a highly representative approximation of the country paired with a robust state and local party infrastructure

Michigan currently holds an edge over Minnesota But Michigan may face pushback due to its larger size some members said given that the committee has frequently raised in previous meetings that states should be small and accessible enough for lesserknown candidates to campaign and win  The big hesitation that those of us who are proMichigan will hear is Are they too big Will they dwarf the other

2020 when efforts to tabulate the results broke down on caucus night  Its critical that rural states like Iowa have a voice and the party cannot abandon an entire group of voters in the heart of the

well into the criteria set out by the DNC which aimed to prioritize racially economically and geographically diverse states that are competitive in general elections  Thats part of Nevadas pitch to leapfrog New Hampshire should Iowa lose its influential perch atop the calendar In a memo to DNC members Nevada Democrats argued that its small yet diverse population as well as its narrow margins in general elections proves its relevance to the early window  Nevada going first will help Democrats win future presidential elections more so than any other state under consideration wrote Rebecca Lambe a former top adviser to the late Sen Harry Reid DNev  New Hampshire meanwhile can also argue its small size and close general election history has yielded strong presidential contenders for a century It also leans heavily on its own state laws which mandate that it is the firstinthenation primary state and give officials latitude to change the primary date year to year to make sure it stays that way  New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told WMUR that he doesnt believe the committee will approve drastic changes based on my conversations with members he said  Whatever

       " {'guid': 6119, 'text_a': 'The Senate is reportedly weighing a new bipartisan immigration reform framework that involves concessions from both Democrats and Republicans but also has a number of provisions that could ultimately doom it The deal trades increased border security for relief for immigrants who are already in the US but lawmakers are running out of time to pass it before the end of the year  The framework for a potential bill is the product of negotiations between Sen Kyrsten Sinema DAZ and Sen Thom Tillis RNC According to a summary in the Washington Post it would give Democrats a longsought path to citizenship for more than 2 million Dreamers who immigrated to the US as children without authorization That would add 12 trillion to GDP over a decade and 235 billion in net fiscal contributions as estimated by the Niskanen Center a libertarian think tank  Republicans would get additional border security resources and at least a oneyear extension of the Title 42 policy which has allowed the US to use pandemicera health rules to quickly expel nearly 25 million migrants who have arrived on the southern border since 2020 The Government Accountability Office would have the authority to end the policy ostensibly after the government can establish new migrant processing centers on the border  The framework would also provide funding to accelerate the processing of asylum seekers including for those processing centers and to hire additional asylum officers and immigration judges And it has provisions that would allow migrants who arent eligible for asylum to be quickly removed Currently the process of adjudicating an asylum claim typically spans months or even years Existing asylum cases have been pending for an average of 785 days as of October according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University  Though the framework is a mix of Democratic and Republicansupported policies it also has a few potential dealbreakers including the preservation of Title 42 Given that it would need at least 60 votes to pass the Senate under the filibuster that doesnt bode well for its prospects especially because its under a time crunch Theres less than a month left before the new Congress begins on January 3  If were not able to reach agreement on some of the more stringent border security issues this week then its difficult to see how we can get it done Tillis told Roll Call  Key Republican lawmakers are so far hesitant to endorse the framework  Republicans have previously opposed opening up a new pathway to citizenship and theres no sign theyre suddenly willing to do so now particularly given how the GOP has sought to use immigration as a political cudgel against President Joe Biden  Sen John Cornyn RTX told Bloomberg Monday that until the Biden administration owns up to its responsibilities on the border its not possible to pass an immigration bill  Beyond calls to be tougher its unclear exactly what Republicans want the Biden administration to do at the border A House GOP memo released ahead of the midterms detailed plans to fully fund effective border enforcement strategies infrastructure and advanced technology to prevent illegal crossings and trafficking by cartels as well as end catchandrelease loopholes require legal status to get a job and eliminate welfare incentives without calling for any particular spending amount  But those policy proposals were vague and that seems to be by design giving individual Republicans room to define their specific stance and to attack Biden  even as he leaves several Trumpera policies in place including the controversial Title 42 policy Biden is also reportedly considering reviving a Trumpera policy that prevents migrants from applying for asylum in the US if they have not already done so in another country like Mexico  Democrats may not back the legislation either  GOP hesitation might be equal to skepticism on the Democratic side  Sen Dick Durbin DIL and other Senate Democrats have been pushing in the lameduck session to pass protections for Dreamers seeing it as their last chance before the House goes under GOP control in January But they werent talking about pairing that with the kind of border security provisions in the SinemaTillis framework  Durbin hasnt signed on to their proposal but hes leaving the door open for now As the author of the original Dream Act more than 20 years ago I applaud every good faith effort to give these deserving individuals a path to citizenship Ive been in touch with my colleagues and will carefully review their proposal I am determined to do everything in my power to help deliver a Christmas Miracle for Dreamers he said in a statement Monday  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus  which has been calling on Congress to pass protections for Dreamers before the years end  has also yet to stake its position on the framework Sebastian Roa a CHC spokesperson told  that the group hasnt reviewed the legislative text but wants to see lawmakers continue talking and figure it out for the sake of our Dreamers and the repercussions of DACA ending on our communities  Sinema and Tillis are still drafting that text and for Democrats considering the bill the devil may be in the details  A Senate Democratic aide told  that their office is concerned about the provisions on asylum processing and the continuation of Title 42 which they see as a sticking point  If the asylum processing provision is similar to one included in a separate bipartisan proposal that Sinema cowrote in 2021 that would likely alienate some Democrats Immigrant advocates warned that trying to speed up asylum processing to a 72hour turnaround timeframe would infringe on the due process rights of asylum seekers forcing snap decisions with potential lifeordeath consequences  Title 42 has also proved a dividing line in the Democratic Party It was put in place under the Trump administration using dubious public health rationale and has become an overt de facto national immigration and border security strategy due to its effectiveness at keeping migrants out of the US A federal court has struck down the policy leading to its scheduled rollback later this month  Moderate Democrats and those facing tough contests in 2022 including incoming Pennsylvania Sen John Fetterman have questioned the Biden administrations decision to end Title 42 earlier this year Five Democratic senators  Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona Joe Manchin of West Virginia Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire  even joined Republicans in introducing a bill that would have preserved the policy until 60 days after the surgeon general announces the end of the public health emergency related to Covid19  Progressives on the other hand have been calling on Biden to end Title 42 since shortly after he took office As early as February 2021 60 Democratic members of Congress wrote to the administration demanding that it safely and effectively end all expulsions under title 42  as soon as practicable and ensure that migrants can access our nations asylum system  Those provisions alone could make it hard to get the Democratic caucus on board If so that would mean the Sinema and Tillis bill wont have a fighting chance', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",
       " {'guid': 6121, 'text_a': 'A federal judge yesterday issued a temporary restraining order TRO against enforcement of New Yorks ban on firearms in any place of worship or religious observation US District Judge John Sinatra Jr concluded that the rule part of a law that New York legislators passed after the Supreme Court overturned the states proper cause requirement for concealedcarry permits impermissibly infringes on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  Sinatras decision in Hardaway v Nigrelli comes two weeks after US District Judge Glenn T Suddaby issued a broader TRO against New Yorks law in Antonyuk v Hochul The two rulings do not bode well for politicians who try to defy the Supreme Courts June 23 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen by imposing new restrictions on the right to bear arms  The lead plaintiffs in Hardaway are the Rev Jimmie Hardaway Jr pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in Niagara Falls and Bishop Larry Boyd pastor of Open Praise Full Gospel Baptist Church in Buffalo They wish to exercise their fundamental individual right to bear arms in public for selfdefense by carrying concealed firearms on church property in case of confrontation to both themselves and their congregants  Hardaway and Boyd whose lawsuit was joined by the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation are licensed to carry concealed handguns and had consistently done so on church grounds as a safeguard against violent intruders But New Yorks lawwhich prohibits guns in myriad sensitive locations including churchesmade that precaution a Class E felony punishable by up to four years in prison  Under Bruen the state has the burden of showing that such locationspecific gun bans are consistent with this Nations historical tradition of firearm regulation which requires identifying analogous restrictions that have long been recognized as constitutional New York fails that test Sinatra writes The States exclusion is instead inconsistent with the Nations historical traditions impermissibly infringing on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  In the landmark 2008 case District of Columbia v Heller the Supreme Court described laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings as longstanding prohibitions But in Bruen the justices noted that the historical record yields relatively few 18th and 19thcentury sensitive places where weapons were altogether prohibited They included legislative assemblies polling places and courthouses  New York argued that laws enacted by four states Georgia Texas Virginia and Missouri and two territories Arizona and Oklahoma between 1870 and 1890 showed that its ban was consistent with the historical understanding of the right to bear arms   An 1870 Georgia law prohibited the carrying of pistols or revolvers in any place of public worship   An 1870 Texas law made it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine to bring firearms into any church or religious assembly That law did not apply to any person or persons whose duty it is to bear arms on such occasions in discharge of duties imposed by law   An 1877 Virginia law prescribed a fine for bringing a dangerous weapon to any place of worship during services It made an exception for anyone who had good  to carry a weapon in the necessary defense of his home person or property The same law made it illegal for someone to carry a weapon on Sunday at any place other than his own premises unless he had good and sufficient cause therefor   An 1883 Missouri law said anyone convicted of carrying a firearm into any church or place where people have assembled for religious worship could be punished by a fine of 25 to 200 andor five days to six months in jail   Under an 1889 Arizona law someone who carried a firearm into any church or religious assembly would face a fine of 50 to 500 plus confiscation of the weapon   An 1890 Oklahoma law made it illegal to carry a weapon into any church or religious assembly It included an exception for anyone whose duty it is to suppress breaches of the peace  As Sinatra sees it those examples do not meet the test established by Bruen Where a governmental practice has been open widespread and unchallenged since the early days of the Republic the Supreme Court said in that case the practice should guide our interpretation of an ambiguous constitutional provision But it added that to the extent later history contradicts what the text says the text controls because postratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text  The Court cautioned against giving evidence from the late 19th century too much weight Since postCivil War discussions of the right to keep and bear arms took place 75 years after the ratification of the Second Amendment they do not provide as much insight into its original meaning as earlier sources The justices also said territorial laws carry little weight because they appear more as passing regulatory efforts by notyetmature jurisdictions on the way to statehood rather than part of an enduring American tradition of state regulation  Sinatra does not think the analogs cited by New York establish such a tradition The state cites a handful of enactments in an attempt to meet its burden to demonstrate a tradition of accepted prohibitions of firearms in places of worship or religious observation he writes The notion of a tradition is the opposite of oneoffs outliers or novel enactments Rather tradition requires continuity  The six laws are of unknown duration Sinatra writes and the State has not met its burden to show endurance over time Hence the Court is left with a handful of seemingly spasmodic enactments involving a small minority of jurisdictions governing a small minority of population that were passed nearly a century after the Second Amendments ratification in 1791 Those outlier enactments Sinatra adds contrast with colonialera enactments that in fact mandated such carry at places of worship He concludes that the laws are far too remote far too anachronistic and very much outliers making them insufficient to establish an American tradition  Suddaby who concluded that New York had failed to justify many of its locationspecific gun bans was more impressed than Sinatra by the historical evidence regarding firearms in church Based on the historical analogues he wrote it is permissible for New York State to generally restrict concealed carry in any place of worship or religious observation But he noted that three of the six laws cited by New York included one or more of the following four exceptions 1 for those bound by duty to bear arms at the place of worship 2 for those possessing good and sufficient cause to carry a gun at the place of worship 3 for those serving as peace officers at the place of worship and 4 for those for whom the place of worship is his own premises  Taken together Suddaby said those provisions suggest that there also exists a tradition of permitting an exception to this prohibition for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship He also noted that the vast majority of the states in 1868 when the 14th Amendment which made the Second Amendment applicable to the states was ratified did not have this restriction at all Suddaby concluded that the Constitution demands that this provision contain an exception for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship or religious observation  That category presumably would include pastors such as Hardaway and Boyd as well as designated congregants Their concerns cannot be lightly dismissed given horrifying crimes such as the massacres at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs Texas  The plaintiffs motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction notes that the recent history of violence in churches particularly the murder of nine parishioners in Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 has reaffirmed Reverend Hardaways conviction to carry for selfdefense and to keep the peace at his church Since the Charleston shooting it says Hardaway has almost always carried a firearm for selfdefense on Sundays and at services until the effective date of the Place of Worship Ban  New York says that is now a felony The Nations history does not countenance such an incursion into the right to keep and bear arms across all places of worship across the state Sinatra writes The Constitution requires that individuals be permitted to use handguns for the core lawful purpose of selfdefense And it protects that right outside the home and in public Nothing in the Nations history or traditions presumptively closes the door on that right across every place of worship or religious observation  Although Sinatras ruling is limited to this one provision of New Yorks law he notes the perversity of the states response to Bruen Eight days after the Supreme Court struck down New Yorks unconstitutional proper cause requirement for concealedcarry licenses he writes the State responded with even more restrictive legislation barring all concealedcarry license holders from vast swaths of the State  That regulatory strategy has not fared well in the courts so far which has not stopped other states from copying it New Jersey and California are both considering bills that would ban firearms from a long list of sensitive places making it legally perilous even for someone with a carry permit to leave home with a gun', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

nationally syndicated radio show so he can commit himself to a more thorough reflection and education  Prior to Cannons remarks Jackson received backlash for a series of antiSemitic Instagram posts one of which included a quote about Jews falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler He apologized after receiving widespread criticism  In their minds they think that theyre saying something thats educational thats historically accurate and something that is not antiSemitic Hill told Lemon I think part of the reason that they think that way is because they dont understand some of the same stereotypes and tropes that theyre pushing about Jews owning everything about feeding into these conspiracy theories that they have master control over a lot of different industries That theyre also at the same time putting on full display the very reasons why they were persecuted by Hitler to begin with  Hill went on to say that conspiracy theories shared by Jackson and Cannon show that they dont understand how hurtful they can be to members of the Jewish community  I dont think that theyve ever really had the type of conversation that would allow them to have that level of empathy or sympathy and they must understand that antiSemitism is a huge component of white supremacy which were all trying to fight Hill said  In Hills latest piece The AntiSemitism We Didnt See she addressed Jacksons antiSemitic posts and the fallout she received after making an antiSemitic comment while covering the NBA Finals series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics in 2008 as a general columnist for ESPN  The line I used in the column was that if you root for the Celtics thats like saying Hitler was a victim Hill continued And while I know on the face of it there are many people who said that doesnt seem that bad That wasnt really the point The point is that had somebody made a similar joke  lets say it involved slavery or lets say it involved a notorious figure who had been known for persecuting black people I would have been pissed frankly That just allowed me  gave me an entry point to reflect on why I did that so callously  Obviously as black people we understand what our struggle is what our fight is what we have been through how we have been the victims and brunt of institutionalized racism systemic oppression  we could go on and on  Hill added that her experience helped her get into the mindset of why Jackson posted antiSemitic posts  And sometimes we get so wrapped up in that fight that we tend to denigrate other marginalized groups and say no we were persecuted the most No we have been through the most And we disrespect what other marginalized people have been through We may not do it on purpose we may not do it with malice but thats what we do nonetheless Its kind of what I did', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

counsel parents on such lightningrod topics as whether adult children should pay rent and more bluntly How to Get Your Grown Children to Move Out  COVID19 sent adult children back to the nest in unprecedented numbers A stampede of younger millennials and older Generation Z progeny have fled roommates and cramped urban apartments during the pandemic for spacious homes in thinly settled suburbs

highs in 2020 Census figures show 22 percent of men and 134 percent of women  The numbers have retreated since then but not far In 2022 19 percent of men and 12 percent of women in the 2534 demographic cohabit with their parents  We talk in psychology about emerging adulthood as a new stage in life said Carol Sigelman a developmental psychologist at the George Washington University Its this sort of inbetween land  A grown child with a good job can maximize the benefits of living at home amassing savings and retiring debts while paying little or nothing for food and shelter  Returning to a childhood home can also trigger a waking nightmare of rehashed arguments violated boundaries and unattainable privacy not to mention the inescapable sense of being treated like a child  Multigenerational households really are very productive and useful said Jerrold Shapiro a professor of counseling psychology at Santa Clara University But there are some issues The biggest one is as soon as kids get back with their parents no matter how old they are they regress And the parents regress They do it in tandem  Returning from college to the twin bed and One Direction posters of a childhood bedroom is a wellestablished if vaguely humiliating rite of passage for Americas young adults More than half of men and women ages 1824 have lived with their parents consistently since 2011 Census numbers show  They sit at the vanguard of a decadeslong trend spotlighted by the pandemic that has transformed the American household  In the first four decades of the 1900s long before the term failure to launch entered the cultural vocabulary more than twofifths of adults under 30 lived with their parents in multigenerational households often sharing chores on a family farm according to a Pew analysis of Census files The share of young adults living with their folks peaked at 48 percent in 1940  The cohabiting population plummeted in the 1940s and 1950s an era of war prosperity and urbanization bottoming out around 30 percent in 1960 It has risen slowly ever since  Young adults are staying in school longer coping with rising student debt marrying later and waiting longer to buy a first home Many move out of the parental home only to return after losing a job or a roommate Researchers call them boomerang kids  COVID19 sparked a mass relocation with millions of Americans leaving crowded urban cores and shuttered college campuses A Pew survey found that young adults were three times as likely to move as any other age group  In the first half of 2020 the pandemic pushed the share of under30 adults living with their parents from 47 percent to 52 percent a slim majority  In the years since much of American life has returned to normal But many pandemic boomerang kids remain in the parental home twothirds by one estimate  A raft of stories romanticized the new connections forged between grown children and the parents who thought theyd lost them forever  It was a joy to have this time with our adult children David Ellis a dad in Raleigh NC told The Guardian in 2021 after the pandemic put two of them back beneath his roof  Over time some of the societal goodwill has soured The boomerang child has spawned a cottage industry of coverage about coping not with the pandemic but with the young pandemic refugees still colonizing your home  One article enumerates 8 mistakes parents make when their 20something kids move back in Number four is Assuming theyll move out when theyre ready Number seven Letting them wait for the perfect job  Another headline announces Working parents spend more than 1000 per month on adult kids bills That piece discusses a recent survey by the consumer website Savingscom Among the findings 62 percent of adult children living with parents dont contribute at all to the household expenses  A third entry warns Supporting Adult Kids May Cost Parents 227K in Retirement One disturbing takeaway 10 percent of adult children still collect an allowance  Living at home saving money paying back college debt that sounds okay to me said Jim Kinney a certified financial planner in New Jersey But what Ive been seeing recently is more of this failuretolaunch thing The kids living at home because he doesnt want to go out and get a job  Aging parents who support adult children risk shortchanging their own retirement plans Kinney said  In the real world the glory years of when people really pour money into their retirement is the last 10 years of their working lives he said And if youre supporting your kid by paying his car insurance and paying for his groceries and maybe even paying for his medical insurance that takes the opportunity away to pile on the retirement savings in the final years before retirement  Kinney believes most adult children who live with parents should pay at least some rent If theyre a little too comfortable at home he said maybe you need to make it a little uncomfortable  Ideally parents should work out an arrangement with boomerang children before they move back laying out what funds or chores the child will contribute and what boundaries the parents will honor according to Shapiro Its like a prenup he said  Even then relations can deteriorate  Shapiro an expert on emptynest parents once counseled a couple whose daughter had agreed to pay rent when she returned to the family home And she did Shapiro said For about three months And she stayed there for a year and a half And it created a real problem  When a multigenerational household prospers the arrangement can pay rich dividends both for parents and their adult children Parents thrive after all on seeing their children go out into the world and perpetuate the species a concept known in psychological circles as generativity  Most parents are really quite good at this Sigelman said Theyre still parents They want to help their children any way they can  All parents really ask in return she said is to see the adult child is trying to make some kind of progress Theyre in school working on a degree Theyre looking for jobs Theyre making a plan for leaving', 'text_b': None, 'label':

election and its culmination in a mob smashing its way into the US Capitol  Brick by brick the Jan 6 panel has constructed an epic tale from the former president seemingly offthecuff claiming he had actually won on the night of the election to shouting matches in the Oval Office over false claims of election fraud to Mr Trumps nonresponsiveness as the Capitol riot commenced  We dont know what

Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

ArrowRight If the former president is grateful hes not showing it Trump filed suit against CNN on Monday alleging that it has strived to defame Trump in the minds of its viewers and readers for the purpose of defeating him politically This culminated in CNN claiming credit for getting Trump out in the 2020 presidential election according to the complaint filed in a Florida federal court  Trump is seeking 475 million in punitive damages Like other Trump lawsuits this one lacks substance  more bluntly its garbage  with its only utility being as a guide to this countrys wideranging First Amendment protections CNN in earlier correspondence with Trump excerpted in the legal filing told the former presidents counsel While we will address the merits of any lawsuit should one be filed we note that you have not identified a single false or defamatory statement in your letter  Advertisement  Although Trumps financial demands run to nine figures the document behind them is a flimsy 29 pages It takes issue with statements aired on CNN that accuse Trump of pushing the big lie and that characterize him with the false  and defamatory labels of racist Russian lackey insurrectionist and ultimately Hitler  The most facially laughable of these of course is Russian lackey which is not only an innocuous putdown but also rests in part on one of the most infamous moments in US diplomatic history  when thenPresident Trump sided with Russia over US intelligence regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  Follow  s opinions Follow  The other allegedly defamatory labels are no such thing Here are a few claims in the complaint followed by explanations as to why they arent defamatory   Psychiatrist Allen Frances told thenCNN host Brian Stelter in August 2019 Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler Stalin and Mao were in the last century Frances also said He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were He needs to be contained but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies not his person Its crazy for us to be destroying the climate our children will live in Its crazy to be giving tax cuts to the rich that will add trillions of dollars to the debt our children will have to pay Its crazy to be destroying our democracy by claiming that the press and the courts are the enemy of the people Trump argues in his complaint that PolitiFact cited part of Francess statement as a Pants on Fire falsehood  Advertisement  This was a dark moment for CNN Stelter later admitted that he should have challenged Frances he cited technical problems saying he hadnt heard the statement But the unspecific nature of the commentary and the way its couched  that Trump may be responsible for the deaths  place it in the realm of rhetorical hyperbole Shameless commentary isnt always libelous Im reasonably confident that a court would rule that taken in context that passage is an expression of opinion by Dr Frances about the human toll of policies Trump pursued which is protected by the First Amendment Lee Levine a longtime media defense attorney tells me by email   House Democrats in March 2019 likened aspects of Trumps rise to Hitlers as CNN reported then According to the suit the reporting is nothing more than selfserving pronouncements by political opponents of Trump and their news proxy and political participant CNN  Read the statements in question and its clear why theyre not remotely defamatory For instance House Majority Whip James E Clyburn DSC said Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into it Clyburn also said Nobody would have believed it now But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany We had better be very careful  Advertisement  To defame someone you must make a false statement that purports to be a fact about that person In this instance Clyburn is speaking to historical parallels and political trends not launching the sort of ad hominem attacks necessary to win a defamation claim   CNN host Jake Tapper said on a show in January 2022 There is a reason Trump was in Arizona to push the legislature to disenfranchise the states voters based on all of his deranged election lies  Those italics are in the lawsuit apparently seeking to highlight the defamatory sting of Tappers remarks Except they are no such thing Its well established that Trump has been told again and again that his claims about a stolen election are false His persistence in airing these claims suggests that hes lying though Trumps lawyers have said that he subjectively believes that the results of the 2020 presidential election turned on fraudulent voting activity in several key states  Advertisement  Even if Trump believed his own statements however Tappers commentary would be protected as hyperbole  a valued commodity in a democratic society  CNNs lawyers will also likely argue that the challenged statements in the suit are to a large extent protected as assertions of opinion  the very doctrine that Trump deployed to get out of a lawsuit brought by a Republican strategist in 2016  The complaint also argues that CNN has treated Trumps claims of a stolen election differently from various claims by Democrats in recent election cycles Set aside for a moment the fact that Trumps claims have been more persistent more egregious and more impactful as we all saw at the Capitol riot of Jan 6 2021 Even if CNN had treated Democratic claims of voter fraud more favorably that would be protected First Amendment activity Just think what would happen to Fox News if slanted reporting amounted to libel  Advertisement   Licht held a conference call in June 2022 in which he expressed low regard for the wording big lie a term with Nazi origins Since then reads the complaint CNNs onair personalities  including John King Jake Tapper John Avlon Brianna Keilar and Don Lemon among others  have continued to use the phrase in describing Trump and Trumps questions of election integrity despite an apparent admonition from their Chief Executive Officer  So what This is a

all brace for a new era of voting  Show Caption Hide Caption Judge restricts conservative group after alleged voter intimidation A federal judge put limits on Arizona ballot drop box monitors affiliated with a conservative group after alleged voter intimidation Claire Hardwick   On the eve of midterm elections in America  as Jan 6 insurrectionists remain on trial as candidates nationwide deny the results from 2020 as the president warns of a path to chaos  experts on voting and extremism want to make two things clear  First voting in the United States remains extraordinarily safe  Second as millions of Americans still seethe over the 2020 election and cast doubt on the fairness of the electoral process spurred on by lies and disinformation the possibility remains of tense confrontations or even violence at polling places this week  Election workers are stepping down in droves after being harassed and threatened misinformation has ramped up and volunteer groups are stepping in with deescalation training to be used at polling places  Organizations pushing spurious claims of voter fraud now call for volunteers to patrol polling stations and election infrastructure in some states That raises the likelihood of tense interactions between election critics and election officials and voters  Meanwhile observers worry increased tensions could also come in the days and weeks after the elections especially in communities where election deniers are on the ballot or where election results are especially close or delayed  More Arizona becomes epicenter of concerns about voter intimidation  Its a new normal for everyone  election officials law enforcement officers and individual voters  who should be on alert but not panicked as they cast their votes said Jared Holt a senior researcher at the think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and an expert on domestic extremism  When it comes to risks at the polls I keep telling people to be vigilant but not paranoid Holt said Vigilance means being aware of some of the different things that you might see at polling locations and how to respond to those whereas paranoia looks like believing armed goons are waiting outside your polling station now and maybe you just dont want to go vote at all because youre worried about it  Carter Center to monitor voting in Fulton County The Carter Center is training nonpartisan observers to monitor midterm elections in Fulton County Georgia November 5 AP  More Bidens closing argument before midterms  More The week in extremism from   The extremist threat  Several experts on extremism told  the same thing Domestic extremist groups and organizations seeking to sow doubt in the electoral process thrive on spreading the message theyre going to show up in force on election day and confront and harass voters But in reality that seldom actually happens said Marcia JohnsonBlanco codirector of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law  I am suspicious about a lot of these reports of plans to observe polling places and to make sure the wrong voters arent voting JohnsonBlanco said All of that serves as a chilling effect  you dont necessarily need to show but just the fact that its being reported may keep voters away  JohnsonBlanco said electionrelated harassment has historically been disproportionately focused on communities of color particularly in neighborhoods where there is a high proportion of people who do not speak English as their first language  In past years extremist groups particularly the armed antigovernment organization the Oath Keepers have been on the front line of election harassment In 2018 and 2020 Oath Keepers pledged to patrol voting places in large numbers But there were ultimately few reports of harassment from Oath Keepers or other extremists  In 2022 extremist groups have focused their hatred on other targets particularly LGBTQfriendly events like familyfriendly drag shows Holt said  A lot of Proud Boys chapters and other extremist movements are busy at the moment harassing gay people for existing Holt said Were seeing way more calls for Proud Boys chapters to go protest drag events than we are seeing the Proud Boys trying to encourage their people to be poll workers or something like that  Our View Regardless of your political leanings our democracy needs you to vote  Spreading misinformation  JohnsonBlanco and other experts said that this year they are most concerned that groups who specialize in spreading misinformation about elections have been steadily ramping up their presence at the polls on election days  Like extremist groups in years past the organizations driving these misinformation campaigns say they are efforts to document voter fraud  even though such cases almost never really occur  These groups are openly encouraging volunteers to monitor polling places film the electoral process and even set up hidden cameras at locations where votes are dropped off  Compounding the issue several states have loosened their restrictions on what socalled election observers can and cannot do legally said Sophia Lin Lakin interim codirector of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union  So while such monitors may not hassle voters in person their false claims lead to more harassment of election officials Lakin said  All of that is making the situation worse she said  In some states harassment from those quarters often from people who falsely claim Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election has already had a negative impact on the democratic process  Ten of Nevadas 17 counties have seen their top election official resign retire or decline to seek reelection since the 2020 vote which the state government calls a drastic exodus according to Reuters  Arizona has seen some of the most divisive debates over election security since the 2020 presidential election and several candidates on the ballot have campaigned in part on the lies that the last election was corrupt  In Maricopa County Arizona a federal judge on Nov 1 ordered a group of selfappointed election monitors to dial back their presence at ballot dropoff locations ordering them to stop wearing body armor or carry visible firearms within 250 feet of the box The judge also banned them from yelling at or otherwise confronting people dropping off ballots and ordered their leader to post a statement about the legality of ballot drops to her Trumpbacked Truth Social network account  Destroying the system from within  Looming over this years elections is the specter of the Jan 6 insurrection Inspired by lies and disinformation the Capitol riot was at its core aimed at stopping the certification of the 2020 election It remains a stark example of electoral interference that experts worry inspires wouldbe wrongdoers as much as it troubles election workers  That idea  that those who dislike an elections outcome can use violence to shut it down  has spread from the Capitol riot to the ballot with dozens of election deniers running for office across the country  What worries Olivia Troye a former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Mike Pence is that candidates who undermine the election process are learning that their conspiracy theories earn them votes  She warned that even if voting is peaceful  and she worries it wont be  some candidates will put themselves in a position to destroy the system from within  Things have gotten worse because of this monitoring this intimidation The seed has been planted since 2020 and its gotten worse she said And the threats to election officials are getting worse  Troye a lifelong Republican quit the White House in August 2020 over the administrations handling of the coronavirus pandemic She endorsed Biden in the 2020 presidential election  We have an entire antidemocracy operation happening before our very eyes Troye said There has been an ongoing effort focused on changing the rules of elections and changing the referees who oversee elections so that they can change the results and overrule the will of the people All of this is correlated to the long term effect of the lies theyve been told by the political leaders they embrace We saw what it led to on Jan 6th and that sentiment hasnt dissipated  Law enforcement standing by  In Arizona despite the recent judges order Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said his deputies were prepared to intervene swiftly if they see any evidence of intimidation or violence  Were staffing and preparing for a worstcase scenario Were not going to tolerate anything Penzone told  We want to make it abundantly clear that theres zero tolerance for anyone whose intentions are to interfere with undermine or adversely affect the electoral process  Penzone said he recognizes most observers are doing nothing more than exercising their constitutional rights to gather or bear arms and promised deputies would respect and protect those rights  But Penzone a Democrat who defeated the Trumpaligned Joe Arpaio in 2016 said hed draw a hard line at anything intended to be intimidating  Its not partisan Its not emotional Its not subjective he said  The Department of Justice is working with US attorneys and specially trained FBI agents at 56 field offices to handle Election Day complaints about election fraud and voter intimidation a standard practice  Those DOJ teams will be stationed around the country while the polls are open People who need to report voter intimidation should first call 911 for their local law enforcement agency and then contact the Justice Department officials said in a news release And concerns about votingrelated civil rights violations should be directed to the DOJs Civil Rights Division  In New York state where Democrats have held the governors mansion since 2006 but where this years race has become unexpectedly close sheriffs statewide are prepared if needed In addition to providing security at polling places sheriffs in New York can be ordered to impound and secure ballots during disputes  Were standing by said Peter Kehoe executive director of the New York Sheriffs Association Hopefully all goes smoothly in New York And if it doesnt well be ready  Election workers trained and prepared  Even in states where intimidation and violence havent yet been major factors this election cycle the mood surrounding elections is much more tense than it was just a few years ago election experts say  State and local voting officials mediation experts and peacekeepers are focusing on deescalation training increased security and rapidresponse measures  strategies added in just the past few years out of a sense of preparation and precaution  Some of the longtime clerks tell me that 10 or 20 years ago they were greeted on Election Day with pies and hugs Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told  They tell me that its a very different environment sometimes now  Rising political tensions parallel the increases in election misinformation and outright falsehoods especially those that followed former President Donald Trumps false claims of a stolen 2020 presidential election and the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on Jan 6 2021  I think the biggest trend that we are seeing is the epidemic of misinformation disinformation and malinformation when people believe lies about the 2020 election or think it was stolen Bellows said That as we saw at the events of Jan 6th can motivate some individuals to take violent action  After two threats against local elections clerks in Maine  one online and one inperson  the state Legislature passed bipartisan legislation last year making threats against elections officials a crime to be investigated by the state attorney general The legislature also instituted deescalation training for local election clerks overseen by Bellows office and security assessments for polling places and municipal offices conducted in concert with the national Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Bellows said  Is voter intimidation a crime Arizona police talk ballot box concerns The Maricopa County Sheriffs Office is monitoring ballot drop boxes after two men in tactical gear with weapons were seen near one in Mesa Arizona Scott L Hall and Patrick ColsonPrice   Election peacemakers  A group of faith leaders and social workers operating as part of the religious political group Faith in Public Life began responding to pollingplace conflicts in 2021 The group which uses deescalation strategies to try to defuse potential clashes began its election work in 2020 and is ready to respond in 2022 said the Rev Dan Clark Ohio director for Faith in Public Life  A lot of times an election peacekeeper wont necessarily square up with the intimidator and try to solve whatever problem theyre creating he said Instead an election peacekeeper often shows up in solidarity with the voters and brings that calming presence so that they can stay in line confidently and vote  Clark warns against overstating the severity of the problem His groups peacekeepers responded to just five pollingplace conflicts in the 22 Ohio counties that the group covered during the 2020 campaign  all on Election Day and the weekend preceding it  It hasnt been called in yet this year during early voting  But the mood at voting sites has changed in recent years raising the prospects for potential intimidation and violence Clark said And ominously in the aftermath of the Jan 6 insurrection and other instances of political violence this years peacekeeper training included a new element lessons in how to respond to an activeshooter situation he said  Conflict resolution and deescalation skills traditionally focused on confrontation and violence in highpressure situations like contested divorces and workplace rage are now being tailored to the increasingly stressful world of elections  For four decades the Mediation Center a nonprofit serving Savannah Georgia and the surrounding area has offered mediation and conflictresolution services to government agencies and other groups often dealing with workplace and domestic conflicts that can become violent Only this year did it start getting deeply involved in training election workers at the request of government workers said Dan Rowe the Mediation Centers senior manager of community programs  Training consists of lessons on situational awareness finding ways to use language to avoid increasing agitation and planning ahead for different conflict situations to avoid making mistakes under the pressure of a threatening situation Rowe said  Even if not all the training and security is needed now it can help deescalation experts and election workers get ready for the future  2022 isnt the last election that ever gets held Rowe said Weve got races coming up in 2023 Weve got the big one in 2024 I dont want to say prepare for the worst because that sounds very pessimistic But be prepared is the goal  Rowe doesnt expect pollingplace peace to be achieved by 2024 either I havent heard any indicators that the temperature is

Devastating waves of COVID19  No one thinks this year will be anything like the last two dark pandemic winters at least when it comes to COVID19 But the country is now dealing with a different kind of threat  an uedictable confluence of old and new respiratory pathogens    Were facing an onslaught of three viruses  COVID RSV and influenza All simultaneously says Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Were calling this a tripledemic  Flu and RSV are back big time  The respiratory syncytial virus RSV began surging unseasonably early this year infecting babies and young children who had little or no immunity to that virus which wasnt circulating all that much over the past two years in part because of COVID19 precautions  The RSV resurgence is still flooding pediatric emergency rooms and intensive care units across the country Some parents are being forced to wait more than eight hours in emergency rooms for treatment for their very sick kids  Intensive care units are at or above capacity in every childrens hospital in the United States right now says Amy Knight president of the Childrens Hospital Association Its very very scary for parents  At the same time an unusually early and severe flu season is surging dominated by the H3N2 strain which often strikes kids and older people especially hard  Influenza has hit the southeastern United States Its moved into the Southwest Its going up the East Coast and into the Midwest with some ferocity Schaffner says  From coast to coast hospitalizations for the flu are at the highest level for this time of year in a decade according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Flu activity is high right now and continuing to increase says Lynnette Brammer an epidemiologist in the CDCs influenza division The good news is the vaccines this year are wellmatched to the viruses that are currently circulating and there is still time to get vaccinated  But now comes another Thanksgiving  These holiday celebrations with all their travel and their close contact usually function as virus accelerators Schaffner says Were spending a lot of time with each other Were laughing and breathing deeply And thats an ideal environment for these respiratory viruses to spread to others  What will COVID do this time  Of course COVID19 is still sickening tens of thousands and killing hundreds of people every day And new even more contagious omicron subvariants that are especially adept at infecting people  even if theyve been vaccinated or previously infected  are taking over    Theres a lot of moving parts here says Dr David Rubin whos been tracking the pandemic at the PolicyLab at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia  What is this all going to mean for COVID Are we going to see a JanuaryFebruary resurgence of COVID thats going to be fairly significant That may yet be coming  Many infectious disease specialists say the immunity people have from vaccinations and infections should keep any new surge of COVID19 infections from causing a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths  Im hopeful given where we are with COVID that were not looking at something like last winter But at the end of the day Mother Nature gets the final word on these things Dr Ashish Jha the White House COVID19 Coordinator told   Were in new territory here with three viruses all circulating at high levels simutaneously he says  I think its a really worrisome situation looking to the weeks coming ahead says Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist who runs the Pandemic Center at Brown University  Nuzzos worried because an exhausted nation has abandoned many of the precautions people were taking to protect themselves and others Flu vaccination rates are down by about 10 to 15 from previous years Only about 11 of those eligible for the new bivalent omicron boosters have gotten boosted  We cant just resign ourselves to assuming that its going to happen no matter what she says We can very much take action to prevent a rise in hospitalizations and deaths    Nuzzo and others experts say Americans can get vaccinated and boosted especially if they are at high risk because of their age or other health problems  People should consider Zooming for Thanksgiving if theyre sick testing for COVID19 before gatherings especially those involving older friends and relatives and other vulnerable people and even consider putting that mask back on as much as possible    If youre not eating or drinking its probably a smart idea to protect the immunocompromised the infants as well as the older individuals in the household says Dr Tina Tan an infectious disease specialist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine    There are hints that RSV may already be peaking and the flu could also peak early before any new COVID19 surge emerges That would help relieve at least some of the pressure on hospitals  Theres even a theoretical possibility that the flu and RSV could blunt any new COVID19 surge in the same way the coronavirus crowded out those viruses the last two years One possibility is a phenomenon known as viral interference which involves the presence of one virus reducing the risk of catching another  COVID could be outcompeted which is potentially good news Rubin says', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",
       " {'guid': 6930, 'text_a': 'John Oliver is not a doctor but he apparently played one on his program Sunday night  In a new episode of Last Week Tonight the talk show host made a slew of false and misleading claims about genderaffirming care and the adolescents seeking it Most of his smuglydelivered claims relied on jabs at Republicans clips taken out of context strawman arguments and activistapproved talking points  In a recent article published in City Journal Leor Sapir a fellow at the Manhattan Institute rebutted each claim Oliver made beginning with Olivers insistence on shoehorning transgenderrelated issues under the umbrella of LGBTQ rights  Oliver demonstrates his lack of critical thinking at the outset when he informs his audience that he is about to discuss LGBTQ rights said Sapir This is yet another example of activists using the LGB as a cover for the T exploiting public sympathy for the former in order to conceal the radical nature of the latter he adds  Oliver attributes societal acceptance for the meteoric rise in transgender identification but contradicts himself in the next breath by saying America is a hostile environment for LGBTQ people rife with violence threats and harassment  If trans kids  are coming out in droves because of warming social attitudes rather than social contagion an explanation he dismisses as horse s it cannot also be the case that American is increasingly becoming a hellhole for LGBTQ people said Sapir  Oliver incessantly frames any criticism of transgenderrelated issues as a rightwing overreaction Some on the right have truly lost their minds about trans rights Oliver diatribes relying on clips from Republican candidates running for office who have used trans issues as part of their political campaigns but neglecting to include the various ways Democrats have also used it to elevate their platforms  He attributes all opposition to the trans movement to the right as if feminists gay rights activists and even some transgender or transsexual as they often prefer to be called people and groups are not key constituencies in the opposition to medical transition for minors said Sapir who believes that this was a deliberate choice  This framing is clearly intended to persuade moderates and liberals that they are safe in supporting gender affirming care because only those people oppose itnever anyone with secular progressive values he adds  In what may have been an attempt at humor Oliver dismisses the socialcontagion hypothesis as total horses The socialcontagion theory posits that peer influence may contribute to transidentification especially in the extraordinarily high rates of teenage girls in recent years seeking transition  Olivers dismissal of social contagionwhich to be sure remains a working theoryis highly irresponsible and disingenuous Sapir said  Scholars with years of experience treating and doing research on minors with gender dysphoria have observed a dramatic increase in the sheer number of teens showing up for transition in their sex ratios age at onset of conditions and high rates of mental health problems alongside gender distress he added  Oliver makes an appeal to authority by citing the medical institutions that caved to transgender ideology  American medical organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics have gotten the science wrong in the past there is no reason to assume that this could not happen again said Sapir  Another major revelation missing from Olivers bit is any mention of progressive countries such as Sweden and Finland that have changed course in treating adolescents with gender dysphoria in favor of a more cautious approach  Oliver never once mentions Sweden and Finland or the systematic reviews of the evidence that have led their health authorities to place severe restrictions on hormones said Sapir  Oliver narrows his focus to genderaffirming care the model adopted by pediatric gender clinics across the county that discourage medical professionals from questioning a minors selfreported transgender identity or exploring possible underlying factors that may be causing their dysphoria  Oliver makes the very misleading claim that social transition using a childs preferred name and pronouns is totally harmless said Sapir In fact all available research suggests that this seemingly innocent act of support is an active psychosocial intervention with potentially iatrogenic consequences  The comedian also claims that puberty blocking drugs are reversible and only a pause button on puberty However this relies entirely on referencing their approved onlabel use to treat precocious puberty in young children not how they are increasingly being prescribed offlabel to treat gender dysphoria in adolescents  Oliver briefly concedes that sterility can happen as a result of these treatments which Sapir said is misleading  When taken as a followup to puberty blockers sterility is virtually guaranteed since the organs responsible for producing sex gametes ova and sperm are not allowed to develop he said  The talk show host also neglected to mention the impact that the combination of puberty blocking drugs and crosssex hormones have on sexual function such as impairing an individuals ability to ever achieve an orgasm  Transgender surgeon Dr Marci Bowers infamously conceded that of the 2000 or so people on whom she has operated none have been able to achieve sexual satisfaction said Sapir  Oliver deceptively cites a statistic on the transition regret rate of adults and attributes it to the subject of his program adolescents The 2 statistic is taken from studies on those who transitioned as adults not minors who were transitioned under the affirmative protocol said Sapir who says that studies on the rates of regret for minors receiving gender affirming care dont yet exist  Throughout his segment Oliver features several interviews with transidentifying teens and children but deprives his audience of a truly balanced segment on genderaffirming care by neglecting to include the testimony of detransitioners Perhaps he is afraid that if allowed to tell their story they will elicit sympathy and skepticism toward the medical professionals who rushed them into irreversible harm remarks Sapir  The benefits of providing care are immense and the risks of withholding it are dire said Oliver relying on the debunked affirmorsuicide myth often perpetuated by activists  Studies that claim trans youth are at elevated risk of suicide are commonly compared with average mentally healthy teenagers which is deeply misleading When researchers compared trans youth with teens suffering from similar mental health problems there was little difference in suicide rates between the

doing to support Ukraine is in support of Ukraines independence its sovereignty its territorial integrity We are providing Ukraine with what it needs to use on its sovereign territory on Ukrainian soil to take on Russian aggressors  The US and a number of its NATO allies have turned aside requests from Kyiv for weapons such as fighter jets with the range to strike far beyond Ukraines borders The Wall Street Journal reported recently that the Pentagon had altered HIMARS rocket launchers sent to Ukraine which have proved highly effective to ensure they lacked the range to fire into Russia  Still the distinctions Washington has tried to draw appear to be lost on some top Russian officials  You shouldnt say that the US and NATO arent taking part in this war You are directly participating in it Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in a video call last week and not just by providing weapons but also by training personnel You are training their military on your territory on the territories of Britain Germany Italy and other countries  The Kremlin vowed Wednesday to ramp up its air defenses after two days of drone strikes The first strike targeted the Engels and Dyagilevo military bases in Russia on Monday Although Kyiv has not claimed explicit credit for the attacks Ukrainian drones also are believed to be responsible for a strike on an airport in Russias Kursk region and an industrial plant about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border  Western intelligence officials said Wednesday that Russian troops are increasing their ground defenses along the Ukrainian border in an apparent effort to defend against a Ukrainian ground invasion That prospect would have seemed unthinkable when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion in February or even just a few months ago  SEE ALSO British officials Russia appears to be prepping for invasion by Ukraine  Ukrainian officials have been careful to avoid taking direct responsibility for the drone assaults but their public comments strongly suggest that their military forces carried them out  The Russians will have less aviation equipment after being damaged due to these mysterious explosions Yurii Ihnat a spokesman for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Wednesday This is undoubtedly excellent news because if one or two aircraft fail then in the future some more aircraft may fail in some way This reduces their capabilities  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the Donetsk region one of the epicenters of fighting in eastern Ukraine to mark his countrys Armed Forces Day on Wednesday Mr Zelenskyy has shown a repeated willingness to travel to the front lines despite the danger  Everyone sees your strength and your skill  Im grateful to your parents They raised real heroes he told Ukrainian service members  Russias baffling failure  Although the Biden administration says its support for the Zelenskyy government is meant solely to defend and take back Ukrainian territory officials made clear that they arent standing in the way of Ukrainian efforts to take the fight to Russia Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said late Tuesday that the US is not actively trying to halt Ukrainians development of drones longrange missiles or other capabilities that can hit Russian targets  The administration is walking a tightrope Given Russias relentless focus on civilian targets in Ukraine over the past few months there would be little moral objection to Ukrainian attacks on Russian assets at home  The US and NATO which have insisted from the beginning that they are not seeking a direct war with a nucleararmed Russia cannot be seen to be encouraging or aiding those operations in any way Moscow almost surely would consider such cooperation with direct attacks on Russian soil as an act of war potentially leading to a direct confrontation between the worlds leading nuclear powers  There are significant questions about how Ukrainian troops carried out the attacks without any outside help whether it be from the US or another Western ally Before the attacks Monday and Tuesday it was widely believed that Russian air defenses were capable of detecting and shooting down Ukrainian drones before they could strike targets in Russian territory especially crucial military facilities central to the Russian war effort  Baffling Samuel Bendett a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security told Business Insider referring to the Ukrainian strikes  Why didnt Russian air defenses track and identify the targets so deep inside the country said Mr Bendett who is closely tracking the RussiaUkraine war and the use of drones in the conflict  The Dyagilevo base is just 150 miles from Moscow Before this week few thought Ukraine had the capabilities to strike a target so deep into Russia  Citing sources close to Mr Zelenskyy ABC News reported Wednesday that Ukrainian special forces were deep inside Russian territory at the time of the strikes and helped guide the drones to their targets The presence of Ukrainian ground troops operating on Russian soil would be an embarrassment for Moscow and a massive security breach suggesting that Russian forces are not entirely able to protect their own territory  After the attacks Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov vowed that Moscow will take the necessary measures to ramp up its air defenses Mr Putin spoke about the war in Ukraine in broad strokes Wednesday but acknowledged that the special military operation is taking longer than expected  As for the results of the special military operation some of them may manifest themselves only after a long while the Russian leader said He added that Russias annexation of four eastern Ukrainian provinces is a major success  New territories have appeared This is a significant result for Russia he said  Meanwhile British officials said Russia has begun extending defensive positions along its border with Ukraine and deep inside its Belgorod region  Although some trenchdigging in Belgorod has been reported since at least April the new construction efforts appear to include more elaborate systems designed to rebuff an assault by mechanized military units British military intelligence officials said in a Twitter post  Russian authorities may be promoting such defensive preparations in its own territory to burnish patriotic attitudes among its own people  However it probably illustrates some Russian decisionmakers genuine but false belief that there is a credible threat of invasion by Ukrainian forces British officials tweeted   Staff writer Mike Glenn contributed to this article which is based in part on wire service reports   Ben Wolfgang can be reached at

       " {'guid': 7059, 'text_a': '   Covid19 is here to stay  Its highly unlikely that the United States let alone the world will be able to completely eliminate the coronavirus that causes Covid19  But there will come a day when its no longer a pandemic when cases are no longer out of control and hospitals arent at great risk of overflowing with patients Many experts predict the spread of coronavirus will look and feel more like seasonal influenza  Whats less clear is how and when that will happen  Theres not even a measurement to say that something is an epidemic or pandemic All of this is in the eye of the beholder  and thats part of the issue Dr Arnold Monto a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan and acting chair of the US Food and Drug Administrations Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee told   So all of this is not based on rules Its based typically on what you have to do to control the outbreak Monto said What is so different here is that our vaccines are much more effective than what we usually see  The good news according to Monto is the power of vaccines The bad news comes with the power of the virus to change and evolve  No one can predict what the future of Covid19 could look like  and the emergence of coronavirus variants like Delta has shifted the trajectory he said  With the change in transmission patterns as the variants have emerged  I call it a parade of variants  we now see much more extensive transmission and much more uniform spread globally This makes declaring the end of the pandemic more difficult Monto said Because the whole pattern of spread has changed and there may still be pockets that really havent gone through the kind of waves that the rest of the world has gone through  Wait and see and hold our breath  Monto and other public health leaders anticipate that in the future the world could track the spread of SARSCoV2 the coronavirus that causes Covid19 in ways similar to how the seasonal flu is monitored  We have no idea whether were going to see that kind of seasonal pattern with SARSCoV2 but it does remind us that most of our respiratory viruses start behaving as seasonal events Monto said  There is the precedent for a very seasonal pattern for some of the coronaviruses that have been infecting people he added Whether SARSCoV2 starts to behave like that we dont know but at least it gives us one scenario that it might start to behave like that  As Monto put it we have to wait and see and hold our breath to unlock what an endemic phase of the coronavirus might look like  Endemic means that a disease has a constant presence in a population  but its not affecting an alarmingly large number of people as typically seen in a pandemic Even in early 2020 as the pandemic was ramping up officials at the World Health Organization predicted that the novel coronavirus may become another endemic virus in our communities and never go away  When you think about pandemics youre in the pandemic phase and then you have a deceleration phase then you have a control phase then hopefully youll have elimination and maybe eradication Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the US Senate Committee on Health Education Labor  Pensions in a hearing on Thursday  What we hope to get it at is such a low level that even though it isnt completely eliminated it doesnt have a major impact on public health or on the way we run our lives Fauci said So if we get more people vaccinated globally and more people vaccinated now hopefully within a reasonable period of time we will get to that point where it might occasionally be up and down in the background but it wont dominate us the way its doing right now  While the US Department of Health and Human Services last month renewed its determination that a public health emergency still exists in the United States due to Covid19 federal health officials already are thinking about how to measure the end of the pandemic and how to continue to track the coronavirus once it becomes endemic  There is still much to be done  To transition from pandemic to endemic the nation has to build up immunity to the coronavirus  which means many more people need to get vaccinated Dr Philip Landrigan a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College told   With some Americans still refusing to get their Covid19 shots and some refusing to wear masks the transition could take more time  Currently about 58 of the total US population is fully vaccinated against Covid19  We have to get somewhere well north of 80 possibly even well north of 90 of the population with immunity either through having had infection or through having had vaccinations said Landrigan who worked at the CDC for 15 years  To control the spread of the measles virus in the US population for instance we had to get the immunity rate up above 95 and even then weve had sporadic outbreaks These outbreaks typically occur when you have a cluster of people in a particular place who are not immunized and all of a sudden the virus gets introduced because a traveler has come in with the virus  and bang youve got 20 cases of measles in some town Landrigan said But thats not an epidemic Its an outbreak against a background of almost no cases or scattered endemic cases  For now the CDC says theres much work to do to control the current spread of the virus  We know there is still much to be done to stop the spread of COVID19 and end the pandemic We are still seeing far too many new cases hospitalizations and deaths The daily average of cases is over 70000 a day with more than 1000 deaths This is why were encouraging everyone 5 years and older get vaccinated to protect them against COVID19 CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund wrote in an email to  last week  As we look forward to the fall and winter its important to continue practicing prevention measures that we know work  vaccinating wearing a mask in public indoor settings staying home when you are sick and washing your hands frequently  Health officials are familiar with the work needed to improve vaccination rates  The CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot every year But during the 20192020 flu season only about half of those people  518  did according to the CDC The agency estimates that flu has caused about 12000 to 52000 deaths each year between 2010 and 2020  The coronavirus has killed more than 750000 people in the United States so far  The battle to corral coronavirus every year may look very much like the annual fight against the flu  Weve been thinking a lot about what an endemic phase looks like and the data that were needing to collect during that phase Certainly right now we are collecting data on cases hospitalizations deaths Dr Rochelle Walensky director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in Thursdays Senate committee hearing The question is What are going to be our best metrics moving forward And probably modeling it on flu  A more likely picture of our future  The CDC collaborates with health departments laboratories hospitals and health care providers to track diagnosed flu cases determine what influenza viruses are circulating and measure the impact those viruses are having on hospitalizations and deaths  One idea is that when the coronavirus becomes endemic a similar tracking system could be used to monitor the pathogen  We could handle the cases just like we do with seasonal flu  where were able to say we know were going to see a number of cases in the winter season and we can have the right staffing we can have the right supplies ready and were ready to handle it as opposed to the surges that weve been dealing with here Dr Stephen Parodi national infectious disease leader for Kaiser Permanente told   Im still on phone calls talking about whats our ICU bed capacity Whats our supplies chains that we need to provide care to patients Do we have enough medication Do we have enough monoclonal antibodies Parodi said We have a lot more work to still do to get to where we want to be and I think were going to see this transition over year 2022 But for some locales where theres less immunity its going to be a longer run  Get  Healths weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the  Health team  Even flu is unpredictable and doctors have seen a lot of flu over the years  We know there are going to be cases Monto said With the flu weve had experience with flu pandemics before So we know typically the way they behave This has been an evolving situation with a totally novel pathogen', 'text_b': None, 'label':

       " {'guid': 7088, 'text_a': 'Invisible Divides How Gen Z Could Transform American Politics PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER  GETTY IMAGES  Welcome to Invisible Divides a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans These beliefs about education religion gender and race align with partisanship  but run much deeper Differences like these dont just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote but also how they think about their place in America And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable  Julian Morein was sitting in the back room of a Hillary Clinton campaign office when he realized that Donald Trump was going to win the 2016 election He was 17 years old and although he was just a few months away from being able to vote he had been spending all of his free time working to get out the vote for Clinton in his home state of Pennsylvania I remember everyone my age just feeling like our futures had been stolen he said The older volunteers were devastated of course but they werent as angry For us  the younger people  we felt like the older generations had failed us And now we were the ones who were going to have to pay  Six years later Morein is out of college and working at a nonprofit in Philadelphia Hes voted in every major election since he turned 18 Hes part of a generation of new voters who became adults in the shadow of the 2016 election And according to an August PerryUndemYouGov survey of likely voters politics is especially personal for Generation Z  The youngest generation of voters is more likely than older groups to vote for Democrats  but it also has a much more radical view of how the country should address longstanding problems According to our survey and others voters ages 18 to 29 are more likely than any other cohort  even those only a decade or two older  to say that abortion should always be legal that racism and racial inequality are big problems in the US and that they favored dramatic moves to undo injustices of the past like cash payments to descendants of enslaved people Whats more many young Americans have told us that they feel compelled to vote because their values and goals feel so at odds with the people controlling the levers of power  Historic events of the past few years have defined many young voters worldviews too One such watershed moment was the May 2020 video of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling for nine minutes on the neck of a 46yearold Black man George Floyd killing him A summer of protests against racial injustice throughout the country would follow along with Chauvins conviction  Voters under 30 were most likely to view racism as a systemic problem that must be addressed In our survey with PerryUndem and YouGov they were the only age group with a majority 57 percent in favor of cash payments for descendants of enslaved people When we asked whether they agreed with the statement White men are the most attacked group in the country right now only 26 percent agreed the least of any age group They were also the most likely to think that people of color becoming a majority of the US population would strengthen the country with 39 percent saying so  The group overall was also much more likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement with 63 percent saying they did Support for the Black Lives Matter movement broke down along especially partisan lines as it was the biggest predictor of how respondents planned to vote more than 4 in 5 of those who agreed with the statement I support Black Lives Matter definitely or probably planned to vote for Democrats and similarly more than 4 in 5 of those who disagreed planned to vote for Republicans  In some ways this generation of voters is already living in the United States of the future which may be driving their attitudes According to the Center for Information  Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University the countrys youngest voters are also its most diverse age group in every region Theyre becoming adults in a nation that already looks more like it will in 2050  when demographers project that nonHispanic white Americans will be a minority  than the past Theres also some evidence these young voters have been learning about racial inequities in and outside of school Over half said that they had recently read books that dealt with racism  The young voters we spoke to did not all offer unqualified support for the Black Lives Matter organization itself but many were generally well informed about the movements mission and goals Matthew Messina a 20yearold college student from New Jersey agreed with most of the groups values relating to racial equity and social justice but disagreed with some of their advocacy on specific issues like defunding police departments I think reforming policing should mean more of funding social programs increasing access to counselors for people in mental health crises like that kind of thing he said    Sergio Mata a 30yearold artist from San Antonio said his support of the Black Lives Matter movement had cooled since hed heard about New York Magazine reporting that raised questions about how the organization was spending its donations But he still believed in its ideals and sees racism in his everyday life Mata who is Latino said San Antonio still feels like a very segregated city They say the white people live on the north side Black people live on the east side and then the Mexicans live on the west side he said And even to this day you could still feel that mentality here Despite that he still feels that his home city is a more liberal island in a conservative state He feels uncomfortable traveling elsewhere in Texas like when he visits his boyfriends family near Waco  For Mata legalizing marijuana would be a big step toward erasing racial disparities in the justice system I dont want any people I know sitting in prison over something thats fully legalized in other states he said That still really upsets me  Kelly Jacobs a 26yearold graduate student who lives in Delaware wants politicians to start at a more fundamental level I want them to publicly acknowledge that racism still exists and its still a huge problem she said of the people she voted to elect Systematically we need change  The Dobbs ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion was another turning point for some young voters  evidence to them that the country was going backwards not just on abortion rights but on a wide range of connected issues As abortion bans started being implemented in states around the country Jacobs realized that it was closing opportunities for her There will be certain states where I cant take a job now because I know I wont have a right to an abortion if I need one Jacobs said  The conservative courts ruling was particularly at odds with the views of young Americans who have become much more supportive of abortion rights over the past twenty years According to Gallup which has conducted regular surveys of Americans attitudes toward abortion for decades nearly half 47 percent of 18 to 34year olds in 2022 said they supported abortion rights under any circumstances up from 28 percent in 2001  And as with race many young voters dont see abortion as a discrete issue affecting only the people who want to end a pregnancy A separate PerryUndem survey not conducted in partnership with  conducted after the Dobbs ruling found that young adults ages 1829 were more likely than older age groups to say that it made them think about how abortion relates to other issues like sexism and racism losing access to birth control and the potential for LGBTQ people to lose the right to marry  Joshua Martinez a 21yearold who identifies as an independent but voted for several Republican candidates in the midterms told us that he thought the justices were right to let the states set their own agendas on abortion But he was concerned that the Dobbs ruling might signal the courts willingness to roll back other protections like gay marriage That could impact people I care about he said  These major news events may reshape the electorate The PerryUndem survey found that young adults were more likely than any other age group to say that the Dobbs decision made them want to vote in the midterms and would have a longterm impact on who they vote for But even if younger Americans simply followed the typical pattern for all voters and vote more frequently as they grow older the experiences that could shape their political evolution are happening now  which could in turn shape the future of the country', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

candidates is having a real impact on the race  But this time around the issue is not the illegal ballot harvesting that marred last years contest its the fact the one of the candidates has been effectively running for over two years  Democratic candidate Dan McCready likes to tell his supporters that he began running for the 9th Congressional District seat when his wife Laura was pregnant with their fourth child Their daughter recently celebrated her second birthday  The Republican candidate state Sen Dan Bishop agrees saying that McCreadys marathon campaign is why the race is by all accounts neckandneck in a district that President Donald Trump won by 12 points in 2016  The media sorta relentlessly asks me well why is this race close And I have to remind them Dan McCready has been running for 28 months Bishop told a small gathering of supporters recently at a refurbished barn in Union County outside of Charlotte  McCreadys nearly twoandahalf year campaign and Bishops late entrance into the race is the result of a mailin absentee ballot scheme that led the North Carolina State Board of Elections to throw out the results of the 2018 election After an investigation and a fourday trial the board called for a new election  ThenRepublican candidate Mark Harris dropped his candidacy after admitting to misstatements during the emotional hearing That led to a new primary election which Bishop a conservative state senator won nearly four months ago  The scandal of 2018 which occurred in the more rural parts of the district with fewer voters is not in the forefront of this election But the districts history of absentee ballot fraud isnt ignored either  McCready mentioned it at a getoutthevote rally for supporters at the beer bar Brawleys Beverage on this final weekend of the campaign  a subtle reminder that the fraud happened at the behest of Republicans  This election on September 10 is the peoples chance to get justice and have their vote heard McCready told   Tuesdays election which has become known as the battle of the Dans is being closely watched by national Democrats and Republicans to help gauge voters mood less than 14 months before the 2020 election  McCready a solar energy entrepreneur and former marine is running as a moderate Democrat  country over party  in this district that hasnt seen a Democrat in Congress since 1963 Hes squaring off against Bishop who authored the controversial bathroom bill that prohibited transgender people from using the bathrooms and locker rooms of their gender identity  Both campaigns are closely watching the early vote numbers especially absentee ballots returned by mail Both sides are also watching the vote data closely and are armed with lawyers on staff as well as volunteer lawyers in each of the eight counties to ensure a fair election  Republicans and Democrats working with the campaigns as well as independent watchers say they have seen nothing abnormal in this elections early vote or absentee ballot numbers  The State Board of Election has mandated new forms to be used at the county boards of elections to track who requests absentee mailin ballots and who submits them They board also provides extensive detail on absentee ballots online and they have a team of investigators to follow up on complaints  If theres an anomaly in the absentee ballot data it will be found said Pat Gannon spokesperson for the state Board of Elections  Michael Bitzer professor of southern politics at Catawba College in Salisbury NC who tracks voter data in North Carolina elections says that of all the early votes cast fewer than three percent have been cast via mail which he said is on par with the expected state average  I havent seen any kind of mysterious trends appear like exorbitant absnetee bymail absentee ballot requests Bitzer said I just think 2018 brought such a spot light that everybody is on their best behavior  Still the 2018 election is on the back of minds of voters McCready supporter Mary Lou Cagle said that McCready should have declared the winner instead of calling for a new election that is likely to have lower voter turnout  I wish what they would have done is let Dan win she said I mean just throw those ballots out and let Dan win Bishop who had nothing to do with the absentee ballot scandal said he doesnt think the Republican Party is tainted because of it but he did acknowledge that some frustration among voters about holding a new election  I do think that people were very discouraged that 285000 votes were cast aside on an issue that involved very very few Bishop told  referring to the amount of votes cast in the 2018 election  Dan Bishop the Republican candidate for senate in North Carolinas 9th District speaks with supporters in Hope Mills on Aug 10 2019 Tom Williams  CQRoll Call file  In a tainted vote count McCready was behind Republican Mark Harris in the 2018 race by fewer than 900 votes when Democrats swept congressional districts across the country  Now that Democrats control the House of Representatives political watchers are anxious to see how voters respond to Democrats in more conservative districts  Bishop thinks it will give him an advantage He told  that voters are seeing what the Democrats are all about pointing to the Green New Deal and some Democrats position to decriminalize crossing the border He is tying McCready to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez and Sen Elizabeth Warren  McCready meanwhile has attempted to distance himself from national Democrats and instead run a

Oregons borders so that about twothirds of the Beaver States land mass becomes part of neighboring Idaho The movement has already gained support from nine counties in Eastern Oregon and two more will vote on whether they want lawmakers to work on the logistics of moving the border  It makes more sense for Eastern Oregonians to get statelevel governance coming from Idaho where they share their values share their culture share their politics than it does to be governed by Western Oregon Greater Idaho spokesman Matt McCaw told   Look at any election map and the problem Greater Idaho seeks to remedy is clear By land size Oregon appears conservative Some counties voted nearly 80 for President Donald Trump in the 2020 election But the population centers of Portland Eugene and Bend have made it one of the most liberal states in the country  MIGRATION FROM BIG CITIES BOOSTS HOUSING PRICES IN SMALLER MARKETS  Its always been a problem because the west side has many more voters McCaw said They have the numbers to dictate what happens statewide  An urbanrural divide is nothing new but McCaw said Eastern Oregon is unique because it borders a state that has almost the same values  Idaho voted 639 for Trump and just 331 for President Biden in the last presidential election The Gem State is already a favorite moving destination among Oregonians who prefer its conservative politics or lower cost of living  McCaw said the group envisions 15 whole counties and two partial counties joining Idaho Nine Oregon counties have already voted in favor of exploring the idea further and two more will cast their votes in November  If approved the Morrow County measure will require commissioners to meet three times per year to discuss how best to promote their countys interests in any negotiations regarding the relocation of the OregonIdaho state border Wheeler Countys measure would direct local officials to ask the state to proceed with plans for moving the border  LONGTIME DEMOCRAT EMBARRASSED BY OREGON POLITICS SHAKES UP RACE FOR GOVERNOR RUNS AS INDEPENDENT  Preliminary maps proposed including the entire southern portion of the state reaching to the Pacific Ocean but supporters redrew the maps this year after residents of two southwestern Oregon counties voted only 47 and 49 in favor of the measure  Our whole core principle is that people deserve to have the kind of government that they want and that shares their values McCaw said So we dont want to be dragging anybody into something that they dont want  Even if all 17 counties approve the proposal actually creating a Greater Idaho would face big bureaucratic hurdles The state legislatures of both Idaho and Oregon would have to sign off on the plan as would the US Congress  State boundaries have changed before Maine seceded from Massachusetts in 1820 North and South Dakota were simply the Territory of Dakota before 1889 And Oregons border with Washington was fluid until the late 1950s when the states agreed on specific geographic coordinates as the border rather than the center of the Columbia River which can change with flooding erosion and other factors  There dont appear to be any examples of a large chunk of one state breaking off to join another state instead of just creating a new state like the State of Jefferson movement which proposes creating a new territory out of Southern Oregon and Northern California  Lawmakers in Oregon havent said much about the proposal so far but their counterparts in Idaho seem open to the idea  OREGON GOP GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE SAYS TIDE IS TURNING IN RACE PEOPLE HERE DONT RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN STATE  This year Idaho Rep Barbara Ehardt introduced a resolution stating that representatives would continue discussions regarding moving the border The resolution notes that Oregon has resources that would be highly beneficial to Idaho including timber minerals and water  Advocates for Greater Idaho were invited to share their ideas with the Idaho Legislature last year  I think this is a broader conversation we need to have throughout the United States and in from our rural communities to our urban areas who forget where their food comes from Republican state Rep Laurie Lickley said  But Democratic state Sen Michelle Stennett worried about the logistics of moving the border and nuances between the two states such as Oregons higher minimum wage and legalization of cannabis  How do you blend criminal justice systems and jurisdictions Where does your tax base come from Stennett asked Theres just a lot that isnt being talked about that would need to be fleshed out for this to even be considered  Idahos Republican Gov Brad Little even addressed the proposal in a 2020 interview on Fox  Friends saying he understood why Oregonians would like to have a little more autonomy a little more control a little more freedom  Now three years after the movement began McCaw says its time for lawmakers in both states to start hashing out the details  Weve proven that people in Eastern Oregon want to pursue this idea and were going to keep trying to get as many of those counties as possible to get on the ballot he said But its time for the legislature to pick up the ball and start this discussion  CLICK HERE TO GET THE  APP  And if the hearings happen quickly McCaw is optimistic that the measure could soon be sent back to a vote of the people  By 2024 you could have a border moved he said Absolutely  State representatives for Morrow and Wheeler counties did not respond to  request for comment  Ramiro Vargas contributed to the

The Jan 6 committee seems to have aimed its work at history rather than the shortterm political cycle On Monday it made some of its own for the first time recommending that a former president be prosecuted on criminal charges  But the panels most lasting legacy may be its story After all this time it is still shocking to hear the details of the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and its culmination in a mob smashing its way into the US Capitol  Brick by brick the Jan 6 panel has constructed an epic tale from the former president seemingly offthecuff claiming he had actually won on the night of the election to shouting matches in the Oval Office over false claims of election fraud to Mr Trumps nonresponsiveness as the Capitol riot commenced  We dont know what history will say about this period of American politics But the Jan 6 documentation appears to be the kind of evidence on which history is based  In that sense the hearings were reminiscent of other noteworthy efforts such as the Senate Watergate committee or the ArmyMcCarthy hearings of 1954 says Joanne Freeman professor of American history at Yale University and author of The Field of Blood

about whats happening and to watch at least some people stand up and say That crossed the line thats really important says Professor Freeman  No one should get a pass  Still the vote to recommend that Attorney General Merrick Garland prosecute Mr Trump was the emphatic ending point to the Jan 6 committees work Possible charges listed were inciting insurrection conspiracy to defraud the United States obstruction of Congress and conspiracy to make a false statement  The panel also referred for possible prosecution five allies of Mr Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyers Rudolph Giuliani John Eastman Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro  The committee believes there is evidence Mr Trump committed serious crimes and if the Justice Department concurs then he should be charged as other Americans would be said Rep Adam Schiff Democrat of California in a hallway interview with reporters following the hearing  No one should get a pass The day we start giving passes to presidents

Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote but also how they think about their place in America And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable  Julian Morein was sitting in the back room of a Hillary Clinton campaign office when he realized that Donald Trump was going to win the 2016 election He was 17 years old and although he was just a few months away from being able to vote he had been spending all of his free time working to get out the vote for Clinton in his home state of Pennsylvania I remember everyone my age just feeling like our futures had been stolen he said The older volunteers were devastated of course but they werent as angry For us  the younger people  we felt like the older generations had failed us And now we were the ones who were going to have to pay  Six years later Morein is out of college and working at a nonprofit in Philadelphia Hes voted in every major election since he turned 18 Hes part of a generation of new voters who became adults in the shadow of the 2016 election And according to an August PerryUndemYouGov survey of likely voters politics is especially personal for Generation Z  The youngest generation of voters is more likely than older groups to vote for Democrats  but it also has a much more radical view of how the country should address longstanding problems According to our survey and others voters ages 18 to 29 are more likely than any other cohort  even those only a decade or two older  to say that abortion should always be legal that racism and racial inequality are big problems in the US and that they favored dramatic moves to undo injustices of the past like cash payments to descendants of enslaved people Whats more many young Americans have told us that they feel compelled to vote because their values and goals feel so at odds with the people controlling the levers of power  Historic events of the past few years have defined many young voters worldviews too One such watershed moment was the May 2020 video of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling for nine minutes on the neck of a 46yearold Black man George Floyd killing him A summer of protests against racial injustice throughout the country would follow along with Chauvins conviction  Voters under 30 were most likely to view racism as a systemic problem that must be addressed In our survey with PerryUndem and YouGov they were the only age group with a majority 57 percent in favor of cash payments for descendants of enslaved people When we asked whether they agreed with the statement White men are the most attacked group in the country right now only 26 percent agreed the least of any age group They were also the most likely to think that people of color becoming a majority of the US population would strengthen the country with 39 percent saying so  The group overall was also much more likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement with 63 percent saying they did Support for the Black Lives Matter movement broke down along especially partisan lines as it was the biggest predictor of how respondents planned to vote more than 4 in 5 of those who agreed with the statement I support Black Lives Matter definitely or probably planned to vote for Democrats and similarly more than 4 in 5 of those who disagreed planned to vote for Republicans  In some ways this generation of voters is already living in the United States of the future which may be driving their attitudes According to the Center for Information  Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University the countrys youngest voters are also its most diverse age group in every region Theyre becoming adults in a nation that already looks more like it will in 2050  when demographers project that nonHispanic white Americans will be a minority  than the past Theres also some evidence these young voters have been learning about racial inequities in and outside of school Over half said that they had recently read books that dealt with racism  The young voters we spoke to did not all offer unqualified support for the Black Lives Matter organization itself but many were generally well informed about the movements mission and goals Matthew Messina a 20yearold college student from New Jersey agreed with most of the groups values relating to racial equity and social justice but disagreed with some of their advocacy on specific issues like defunding police departments I think reforming policing should mean more of funding social programs increasing access to

hed heard about New York Magazine reporting that raised questions about how the organization was spending its donations But he still believed in its ideals and sees racism in his everyday life Mata who is Latino said San Antonio still feels like a very segregated city They say the white people live on the north side Black people live on the east side and then the Mexicans live on the west side he said And even to this day you could still feel that mentality here Despite that he still feels that his home city is a more liberal island in a conservative state He feels uncomfortable traveling elsewhere in Texas like when he visits his boyfriends family near Waco  For Mata legalizing marijuana would be a big step toward erasing racial disparities in the justice system I dont want any people I know sitting in prison over something thats fully legalized in other states he said That still really upsets me  Kelly Jacobs a 26yearold graduate student who lives in Delaware wants politicians to start at a more fundamental level I want them to publicly acknowledge that racism still exists and its still a huge problem she said of the people she voted to elect Systematically we need change  The Dobbs ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion was another turning point for some young voters  evidence to them that the country was going backwards not just on abortion rights but on a wide range of connected issues As abortion bans started being implemented in states around the country Jacobs realized that it was closing opportunities for her There will be certain states where I cant take a job now because I know I wont have a right to an abortion if I need one Jacobs said  The conservative courts ruling was particularly at odds with the views of young Americans who have become much more supportive of abortion rights over the past twenty years According to Gallup which has conducted regular surveys of Americans attitudes toward abortion for decades nearly half 47 percent of 18 to 34year olds in 2022 said they supported abortion rights under any circumstances up from 28 percent in 2001  And as with race many young voters dont see abortion as a discrete issue affecting only the people who want to end a pregnancy A separate PerryUndem survey not conducted in partnership with  conducted after the Dobbs ruling found that young adults ages 1829 were more likely than older age groups to say that it made them think about how abortion relates to other issues like sexism and racism losing access to birth control and the potential for LGBTQ people to lose the right to marry  Joshua Martinez a 21yearold who identifies as an independent but voted for several Republican candidates in the midterms told us that he thought the justices were right to let the states set their own agendas on abortion But he was concerned that the Dobbs ruling might signal the courts willingness to roll back other protections like gay marriage That could impact people I care about he said  These major news events may reshape the electorate The PerryUndem survey found that young adults were more likely than any other age group to say that the Dobbs decision made them want to vote in the midterms and would have a longterm impact on who they vote for But even if younger Americans simply followed the typical pattern for all voters and vote more frequently as they grow older the experiences that could shape their political evolution are happening now  which could in turn shape the future of the country', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

the policy that allows the country to turn away asylumseekers  A group of nearly 20 GOPled states are moving to intervene in a case hoping to challenge a decision from a federal judge who struck down Title 42 after determining the government failed to consider less drastic measures when implementing a major shift in immigration policy amid the pandemic  The states effort to angle their way into the suit is accompanied by a request to halt the lifting of Title 42 and a pledge to appeal to the Supreme Court as the policy is set to terminate just days before Christmas  The stakes in these cases over the next few weeks are enormous and will determine whether Title 42 remains in place for months and possibly more than a year said Lee Gelernt a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU and the lead counsel in the Title 42 litigation that resulted in the recent court decision blocking it  Immigration advocates have been pushing for an end to Title 42 since it was first rolled out by the Trump administration The Trump administration used Title 42 to expel asylumseekers from numerous countries into Mexico on public health grounds during the COVID19 pandemic  But its been further embraced by the administration of President Biden which recently moved to expand the policy to migrants from Venezuela  The Department of Homeland Security DHS now finds itself in the midst of competing Title 42 lawsuits as it seeks a way forward  An original lawsuit from states led by Louisiana challenged an April decision from the Biden administration to lift Title 42 That suit led to an injunction that kept the policy in place  A countersuit from the ACLU then toppled the policy with US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ruling Title 42s rollout didnt meet requirements for policy making  DHS is now appealing both rulings  a move in line with a Biden administration that has waffled on how to deal with Title 42 and criticism from the left and right on its border policies  Advocates on the left have criticized the decision to challenge Sullivans ruling arguing it gave the administration political cover to scrap what they see as a cruel policy that contravenes asylum law and turns away those in need of protection  Once the DC District Court came out saying they needed to end Title 42 I thought they were going to point to that court order to appease the political left crowd Were going to do this because we have to and you can be happy were getting rid of Title 42 which you wanted to do from Day One while being able to say to moderates We didnt want to do it but we had to do it said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández an immigration law expert and professor at Ohio State University  Appealing it I dont know what political benefit they get he added  The political right is also criticizing the Biden administration  GOP states have accused the Biden administration of strategic surrender in the case pointing to an agreement with the ACLU to delay the termination of Title 42 until Dec 21 to give DHS time to prepare They are irritated that the Biden administration has not sought a longterm stay of Sullivans ruling while they appeal  They go on to accuse DHS of exploiting calculated surrender to eliminate unwanted rules  The case is now before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where all parties are asking for a ruling by Friday  If the battle escalates to the Supreme Court and it grants the states request Title 42 could remain in place for months while the lower court litigation continues  DHS notified the courts that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC plans to issue new rulemaking on Title 42 something it hopes will nullify the need for litigation in the cases from both the ACLU and Louisiana  But critics see the action of appealing both rulings  one keeping Title 42 in place the other terminating it  as a protection of executive power from an administration that wants the ability to use the policy when it suits its needs  Its a mess its a litigation mess and DHS really does find itself in a perplexing situation said García Hernández  But it makes more sense he said when you think of the Biden administration as invested in the power of the presidency Court wins in the cases would protect the administrations ability both to roll out and unwind the policy without going through the rulemaking process dictated by the Administrative Procedures Act  They want to be able to turn the switch on and off and they dont want anyone else to be telling them that García Hernández said whether it be the courts or the states  The effort to protect the policy comes as the administration faces a steady wave of migration from the south  one that has become a constant feature of attacks from a GOP that claims the border is in crisis  The administration recognizes that Title 42 is no longer justified by public health but is unfortunately still defending CDCs actions so it potentially can invoke Title 42 in the future Gelernt said  The competing litigation stances come as the administration is trying to thread a bunch of legal and political needles he said  Theres no doubt that the administration is allowing politics to interfere with restoring the asylum system the Trump administration decimated Gelernt added  In Congress lawmakers who have pushed for an end to Title 42 have become exasperated by the litigation from an agency that says it wants to end the policy but needs time to prepare for its lifting  Theyve been preparing for some time I think thats my frustration is that weve known about the end but it doesnt sound like theyre ready yet I mean this has been happening for months now Even though they were in court they should have been getting ready Thats my concern Rep Nanette Diaz Barragán DCalif said Tuesday  On the same day another group of lawmakers including two conservative Democrats wrote to Biden urging him to do everything within your power to extend the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDCs Title 42 order beyond the looming December 21st deadline until Congress can act  For its part DHS is fighting the states sprint to intervene before Title 42s lifting arguing they lack standing to join the case  But the department also took a jab at their effort to join a case just days before the policy is set to end  The governments decision not to seek a stay pending appeal does not justify states eleventhhour effort to intervene the government wrote in its brief It should have been obvious  for months that the government might not seek a stay given

Donald Trump wrongly boasted that his administration got 58 hostages released from various hostile countries without paying any money or giving up anything  In fact several of the deals resulting in the release of Americans held hostage or being wrongfully detained abroad came as a result of prisoner swaps during Trumps time in office  In November 2019 the Trump administration secured the release of American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks who were being held by the Taliban in exchange for the release of three senior Taliban leaders being held in jails in Afghanistan  In December 2019 the US did a prisoner exchange with Iran freeing Xiyue Wang a graduate student at Princeton University who was serving a 10year sentence in Iran on espionage charges To secure Wangs release the US freed Masoud Soleimani an Iranian scientist convicted of export violations  In July 2020 the Trump administration secured the release of Michael White a Marine veteran jailed in Iran on charges of insulting the countrys supreme leader in exchange for the release of a dermatologist convicted on export violations  In October 2020 a deputy assistant to Trump helped broker a deal to free two Americans being held hostage by Iranianbacked militants in Yemen in exchange for the release of about 250 Houthi rebels being held in Oman  Trump made the freeing of hostages held in overseas jails an administration priority  In a Feb 7 2020 story for the New Yorker Joel Simon a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University wrote that Trump repeatedly pushed the boundaries of the noconcessions policy upheld by Republican and Democratic Presidents since Nixon Trumps style of resolving cases is more personal and more flexible In contrast to former President Barack Obama Simon wrote Trump has gone out of his way to highlight his personal engagement in hostagerecovery efforts welcoming hostages home on national television or inviting them to Oval Office photo opportunities Trump seeks to showcase his skill as a deal maker and gain the political benefit of bringing Americans home  In a February 2019 review of a book on hostage negotiation by Simon Jason Rezaian of the Washington Post who was held hostage by Iran for 544 days discussed the messy and morally fraught business of negotiating the release of overseas hostages and noted Trumps successes on this front  No government has found a way to prevent hostagetaking and the practice is getting more widespread Rezaian wrote But this is one area where the Trump administration has had some success Andrew Brunson a pastor detained in Turkey was released in October 2018 after the United States imposed sanctions and tariffs Joshua Holt a Mormon missionary was freed in May 2018 after nearly two years in a Venezuelan prison following separate meetings by two US senators with President Nicolás Maduro  But a question still nags Those releases came at what cost For no hostage is ever freed for nothing Rezaian wrote  In remarks on March 30 2019 after the release of American oil worker Danny Burch from Yemen Robert OBrien then the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs touted Trumps unparalleled success in bringing Americans home without paying concessions without prisoner exchanges but through force of will and the goodwill that hes generated around the world  But in the ensuing months that would change as we will detail below  WNBA star Brittney Griner hugs her wife Cherelle after landing back in the US from Russia US Army Photo by Miguel A Negron  Trump is certainly

made the deal for a hundred people in exchange for someone that has killed untold numbers of people with his arms deals But its simply revisionist history to claim his administration got 58 hostages released from various hostile countries without  giving up anything  Xiyue Wang  Wang then a Princeton graduate student was arrested in Tehran in 2016 while doing doctoral research and convicted of espionage He was in the fourth year of a 10year prison sentence when the exchange occurred  Wang was swapped for Masoud Soleimani an Iranian stemcell researcher who came to the US to take a position

internet White later said the visit turned out to be a major major trap He was arrested charged with espionage and sentenced to 10 years in prison According to Reuters White was convicted of two charges  insulting the countrys top leader and posting a private photograph publicly  He had served nearly two years of that sentence when the Trump administration negotiated his release on June 4 2020 in exchange for the release of Majid Taheri aka Matteo Taerri an IranianAmerican doctor convicted in 2018 of export violations  Taheri pleaded guilty and served several months in jail but was free on bond until sentencing when the deal was reached the AP reported The Justice Department dropped its charges against him  The United States government and the government of Iran have been negotiating the release of a US citizen held in Iranian custody federal prosecutor Tracia King said at the hearing This case and more specifically the sentence recommendation is directly related to these negotiations  Trump touted Whites release on Twitter stating I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas  The New York Times reported that before the exchange there had been intensifying speculation that Iran was preparing to release Mr White 48 a cancer patient During the height of the COVID19 outbreak in Iran and several months before the swap White had been transferred out of prison and turned over to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran He was staying in a hotel though he remained on medical furlough and in Iranian custody  After his return to the US White met with Trump to thank him and the meeting was featured on the first day of the Republican National Convention in 2020  Iran is an oppressive extortionist terrorist regime You know what Im talking about White told Trump But what you did sir you were able to get me out of that prison in record time It was amazing  Kevin King  The case involving the release of American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks in November 2019 is a little different from the cases of Wang and White in that King and Weeks were kidnapped in 2016  Nonetheless Trump this week talked about his ability to secure the release of hostages without ever giving up anything So King and Weeks fit the bill  A statement from thenSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Taliban described the release of the two men as a goodwill gesture The statement also notes the Talibans impending release of 10 Afghan prisoners and the Afghan governments release of three Taliban prisoners  Freed in the exchange were three senior commanders of the Haqqani network which was added to the State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations in September 2012 and is closely allied with the Taliban One of the men was a younger brother of the Talibans deputy leader and son of the Haqqani networks founder the Washington Post reported  According to the Washington Post the Haqqani network has been active in kidnapping foreigners and is believed to have seized King and Weeks  Announcing the release of King and Weeks Trump praised thenAfghan President Ashraf Ghani for his courageous support and added Proud of my team The Washington Post reported that Ghani had earlier announced the prisoner swap on live television  Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada  The Intercept reported in October 2020 that the Trump administration secured the release of two other Americans a businessman and a humanitarian worker who were being held in Yemen by Houthis supportive of Iran The latter deal was personally overseen by Kash Patel a deputy assistant to Trump in return according to press reports he facilitated the release of nearly 250 Houthi fighters stranded in neighboring Oman  Freed were Sandra Loli an aid worker held hostage for three years and Mikael Gidada a businessman held for nearly a year The remains of a third captive Bilal Fateen were also released  According to the Washington Post In exchange for the Americans nearly 300 of the rebel groups members were returned to Yemen where some may reenter the battlefield and prolong a conflict that has become increasingly unpopular in Washington  The more than 200 Houthi fighters were captured by a Saudi Arabialed coalition and were being held in Oman  Although OBrien did not mention the exchange he did publicly thank Sultan Haitham bin Tariq of Oman and King Salman of Saudi Arabia for their efforts to secure the release of our citizens  Editors note  does not accept advertising We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you Please

show of public defiance in years                HONG KONGBEIJING Dec 1   China is set to announce an easing of its COVID19 quarantine protocols in the coming days and a reduction in mass testing sources told  a marked shift in policy after anger over the worlds toughest curbs fuelled widespread protests  Cases nationwide remain near record highs but the changes come as some cities have been lifting their lockdowns in recent days and a top official said the ability of the virus to cause disease was weakening  Health authorities announcing the easing in their areas have not mentioned the protests  the biggest show of civil disobedience in China for years  which ranged from candlelit vigils in Beijing to street clashes with police in Guangzhou  The measures due to be unveiled include a reduction in the use of mass testing and regular nucleic acid tests as well as moves to allow positive cases and close contacts to isolate at home under certain conditions the sources familiar with the matter said  That is a far cry from earlier protocols that led to public frustrations as entire communities were locked down sometimes for weeks after even just one positive case  The frustration boiled over last week in demonstrations of public defiance unprecedented in mainland China since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012 The unrest comes as the economy is set to enter a new era of much slower growth than seen in decades  On Thursday night Shanghai train commuters reported wirelessly receiving an unsolicited document onto their phones saying that life in China would only get better if there was a full lifting of lockdown and that Xi step down  an apparently new tactic amid a heavy police presence in some cities ahead of the weekend  CHANGING RULES  Less than 24 hours after violent protests in Guangzhou on Tuesday authorities in at least seven districts of the sprawling manufacturing hub said they were lifting temporary lockdowns One district said it would allow schools restaurants and businesses including cinemas to reopen  Cities including Chongqing and Zhengzhou also announced easings  The sense of official momentum towards a landmark shift built on Thursday as Vice Premier Sun Chunlan who oversees COVID efforts told a meeting of frontline experts that the Omicron variant was weakening in its ability to cause disease allowing China to improve prevention efforts  After nearly three years fighting against the epidemic our countrys medical and healthcare system has withstood the test she said in remarks published by the official Xinhua news agency  The vaccination rate of the entire population exceeds 90 and public health awareness and quality has been improved signifciantly she said  State media reported Sun saying a day earlier that China was facing a new situation in its response to COVID and urged further optimisation of testing treatment and quarantine policies  The mention of weakening COVID pathogenicity contrasts with previous messages from a usually hawkish Sun about the deadliness of the virus  Suns earlier speech in addition to the notable easing of COVID control measures in Guangzhou yesterday sends yet another strong signal that the zeroCOVID policy will end within the next few months analysts at Nomura said in a research note  114 Pandemic prevention workers in protective suits get ready to enter an apartment building that went into lockdown as coronavirus disease COVID19 outbreaks continue in Beijing December 2 2022 Thomas Peter 1 2 3 4 5  These two events perhaps point to the beginning of the end of zeroCOVID  In the capital Beijing some communities have begun preparing for changes  One community in the east of the city held an online poll this week on the possibility of positive cases isolating at home residents said  I certainly welcome the decision by our residential community to run this vote regardless of the outcome said resident Tom Simpson managing director for China at the ChinaBritain Business Council  He said his main concern was being forced to go into a quarantine facility where conditions can be grim to say the least  Prominent nationalist commentator Hu Xijin said in a social media post on Wednesday that many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in Beijing were already quarantining at home  REOPENING NEXT YEAR  Expectations have grown around the world that China while still trying to contain infections could look to reopen its borders at some point next year once it achieves better vaccination rates among its hesitant elderly  Health experts warn of widespread illness and death if COVID is let loose before vaccination is ramped up  Chinese stocks and markets around the world dipped initially after the weekend protests in Shanghai Beijing and other cities but later recovered on hopes that public pressure could lead to a new approach by authorities  More COVID outbreaks could weigh on Chinas economic activity in the near term the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday adding it saw scope for a safe recalibration of policies that could allow economic growth to pick up in 2023  Chinas strict containment measures have dampened domestic economic activity this year and spilled over to other countries through supply chain interruptions  Following downbeat data in an official survey on Wednesday the CaixinSP Global manufacturing purchasing managers index showed factory activity shrank in November for a fourth consecutive month  While the change in tone on COVID appears a response to the public discontent with

the start of hearings next week at the Capitol in Washington Thursday July 22 2021 AP PhotoJ Scott Applewhite  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi DCalif returns to her office where members of the House select committee on the January 6th attack on the Capitol are preparing for the start of hearings next week at the Capitol in Washington Thursday July 22 2021 AP PhotoJ Scott Applewhite  WASHINGTON AP  Unfazed by Republican threats of a boycott House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Thursday that a congressional committee investigating the Jan 6 Capitol insurrection will take on its deadly serious work whether Republicans participate or not  The Republicans House leader Kevin McCarthy called the committee a sham process and suggested that GOP lawmakers who take part could face consequences McCarthy said Pelosis rejection of two of the Republicans he had attempted to appoint was an egregious abuse of power  The escalating tension between the two parties  before the investigation has even started  is emblematic of the raw partisan anger that has only worsened on Capitol Hill since former President Donald Trumps supporters laid siege to the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Joe Bidens victory With most Republicans still loyal to Trump and many downplaying the severity of the violent attack there is little bipartisan unity to be found  McCarthy said Wednesday that he would withdraw the names of all five Republicans he had appointed after Pelosi rejected two of them Reps Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio Pelosi made clear on Thursday that she wont relent and Democrats mulled filling the empty seats themselves  ADVERTISEMENT  It is my responsibility as the speaker of the House to make sure we get to the truth of this and we will not let their antics stand in the way of that Pelosi said of the Republicans  It is unclear for now whether Pelosi will try to appoint more members to the select panel as she has the authority to do under committee rules She left open that possibility saying that there are other members who would like to participate But she said she hadnt decided whether to appoint Illinois Rep Adam Kinzinger one of only two Republicans who voted in support of creating the panel last month  The other Wyoming Rep Liz Cheney has already been appointed by Pelosi to sit on the committee along with seven Democrats  ensuring they have a quorum to proceed whether other Republicans participate or not  Cheney praised Kinzinger saying he would be a tremendous addition to the panel Several Democrats on the panel also seemed to support the idea with Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi saying the military veteran is a the kind of person wed want to have  Banks and Jordan are outspoken allies of Trump who has continued to spread lies about massive fraud in the election and has defended his supporters who broke into the Capitol The rioters fought past police and sent lawmakers inside running for their lives  The House voted in May to create an independent investigation that would have been evenly split between the parties but Senate Republicans blocked that approach in a vote last month Pelosi said the new panel was being created only because a bipartisan commission was no longer an option  Asked Thursday if Cheney  and potentially Kinzinger  could be stripped of their regular committee assignments as retaliation for participating McCarthy said the conference will look at it Cheney accepted the assignment from Pelosi earlier this month despite similar threats from McCarthy  ADVERTISEMENT  Pelosi accepted McCarthys three other picks  Illinois Rep Rodney Davis North Dakota Rep Kelly Armstrong and Texas Rep Troy Nehls But McCarthy said that all five or none would participate  Like Jordan and Banks Nehls voted to overturn Bidens victory Armstrong and Davis voted to certify the election  Banks recently traveled with Trump to the USMexico border and visited him at his New Jersey golf course In a statement after McCarthy chose him for the panel he sharply criticized the Democrats who had set it up  Make no mistake Nancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and to justify the lefts authoritarian agenda Banks said  Democrats whom Pelosi appointed to the committee earlier this month were angry over that statement and concerned over Banks two recent visits with Trump according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the private deliberations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them  Jordan the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee was one of Trumps most vocal defenders during his two impeachments and last month likened the new investigation to impeachment three Trump was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate both times  The panel is also considering hiring former Rep Denver Riggleman of Virginia a Republican who has criticized Trumps lies about election fraud as an outside adviser according to a person familiar with the committees work who was granted anonymity to discuss the private talks  Cheney told reporters she agrees with Pelosis decision to reject the two Republicans named by McCarthy  At every opportunity the minority leader has attempted to prevent the American people from understanding what happened  to block this investigation Cheney said  The panel will hold its first hearing next week with at least four police officers who battled rioters testifying about their experiences Members of the committee met Thursday afternoon to prepare  Thompson said the hearing would allow the law enforcement officers to tell their stories and set the tone for the investigations launch  Seven people died during and after the rioting including a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who suffered medical emergencies Two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed and a third officer Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

for the candidate quality problem that hampered the partys bid to recapture the Senate in 2022 marking the third time in three weeks that McConnell has directly criticized the former president after repeatedly avoiding engaging with him over the past two years  The stronger pushback comes as polls show Trumps support is slipping among Republican voters a trend that has accelerated since Trumpaligned candidates lost important races across the country in the midterm elections  A USA TodaySuffolk University poll published Tuesday showed that 61 percent of Republican and Republicanleaning voters want someone else to be the partys nominee for president in 2024  Close Thank you for signing up Subscribe to more newsletters here  The poll also showed Republican voters prefer Florida Gov Ron DeSantis R over Trump as a potential presidential candidate by a margin of 56 percent to 33 percent  With Trump leaking oil in the words of one GOP senator McConnell isnt wasting any time in striking back against someone who has repeatedly called for his ouster as Senate Republican leader  McConnell told reporters Tuesday that Trump was a big reason why Senate GOP leaders were not able to steer Senate nominations to stronger candidates in key battleground states such as Arizona Georgia and New Hampshire  He had hinted at a press conference a week after Election Day that he thought Trump was a drag on Republican efforts to win back the Senate but he made his criticism more explicit after Republicans lost another key race last weeks Senate runoff in Georgia  We ended up having a candidate quality issue he told reporters Tuesday Look at Arizona look at New Hampshire and the challenging situation in Georgia as well  US Rep Mo Brooks was one of the candidates McConnell actively worked to get out of office while Trump pushed for his reelection  McConnell said his affiliated super PAC the Senate Leadership Fund intervened in the Republican Senate primaries in Alabama and Missouri by investing money to defeat Rep Mo Brooks RAla and former Missouri Gov Eric Greitens  But he argued that Trumps influence with primary voters made it very difficult to weed out weak candidates who had Trumps support or embraced his false claims of a stolen 2020 election  Our ability to control the primary outcome was quite limited in 22 because the support of the former president proved to be very decisive in these primaries So my view was do the best you can with the cards youre dealt Hopefully in the next cycle well have quality candidates everywhere and a better outcome he said  McConnell also took shots at Trump the previous two weeks when he criticized Trumps call to terminate parts of the Constitution to allow himself to return to the White House and condemned Trumps dinner at MaraLago with an outspoken white supremacist and antisemite  The leaders stiffening rhetoric against the former president reflects the growing consensus within the Senate GOP conference that Trump would not match up well against President Biden or another Democrat in the 2024 general election and if nominated for the White House could drag down candidates in Senate races as well  So far Sen Tommy Tuberville Ala is the only Republican senator to have publicly endorsed Trumps 2024 presidential candidacy which Trump launched with a rally at MaraLago on Nov 15  Numerous Republicans went after Trump after he had dinner with Ye and Nick Fuentes a white nationalist Trump said he had no clue who Fuentes was after the dinner was revealed to the public  McConnell questioned Trumps ability to win the presidency after he had dinner with Ye the artist formerly known as Kanye West who has lost business partnerships after making a string of antisemitic comments and Nick Fuentes a prominent white supremacist and antisemite  There is no room in the Republican Party for antisemitism or white supremacy and anyone meeting with people advocating that point of view in my judgment is highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States he told reporters after Thanksgiving  The following week McConnell observed that Trump or anyone else would have a hard time getting sworn into office if he refused to uphold the Constitution a pointed reference to Trumps call for a termination of all rules regulations and articles even those found in the Constitution after new details emerged of content moderation at Twitter during the 2020 presidential election  At the same time Trumps legal problems are mounting and GOP lawmakers think theres a good chance that special counsel Jack Smith will move forward with one or multiple indictments against him  The Justice Department asked a federal judge to hold Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with a subpoena to turn over classified documents he took from the White House  Trumps family business the Trump Organization was convicted last week on 17 criminal counts related to what prosecutors said was a 15year tax fraud scheme  McConnells stiffer stance against Trump also came after the former president encouraged National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott RFla to challenge the senior Kentucky lawmaker for Senate GOP leader  Trump predicted Scott would have a lot of support if he challenged his leader but McConnell defeated him easily in a 3710 vote  McConnell and Trump havent spoken since Dec 15 2020 after McConnell recognized Biden as the winner of the presidential election  Their relationship really soured after McConnell excoriated Trump on the Senate floor for instigating the Jan 6 2021 attack on the Capitol even though McConnell voted to acquit the president of the impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection  But after that scathing floor speech McConnell kept largely quiet about Trumps behavior and controversial comments throughout 2021 and 2022 when Trump repeatedly rehashed his false claims that the presidential election was stolen through widespread fraud  The family of the late Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died in the line of duty defending lawmakers on Jan 6 refused to shake McConnells hand  and that of

still refuses to concede a race the Associated Press called for her opponent weeks ago  Most other electiondenier candidates who lost up and down the ballot and across the country in 2022 have conceded their races with little fanfare But Lake is an almost singular voice calling her states contests one of the most dishonest elections in the history of Arizona in a video posted on Trumps social media network Truth Social on Monday  This botched election should not be certified she added  Monday was the countylevel deadline to certify the results All did with the exception of Cochise County where the Republican majority on the Board of Supervisors delayed certification until Friday citing concerns about voting machines Current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs the Democrat who won the gubernatorial race consequently sued the county arguing that its decision could potentially disenfranchise some 47000 voters  The AP called the race on November 14 and the results werent within the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount In the now complete vote count Hobbs won the gubernatorial election by 17116 votes  That hasnt stopped Lake from questioning the results She has boosted accounts from supporters who claim they had trouble voting argued that Hobbs cannot certify her own election as governor due to conflicts of interest and filed a lawsuit asking Maricopa County the largest county in Arizona to hand over various election records before the statewide canvass of the results which is scheduled to happen on December 5  Those documents include ones that could help identify people who may have not been able to cast a ballot including those who checked in at more than one polling location or who submitted a mail ballot and sought to vote in person Lake also is seeking details on counted and uncounted ballots that were mistakenly mixed Its unlikely that these ballots affected the results  mixing up counted and uncounted ballots is a routine problem in elections that county officials have confirmed happened at a few vote centers this year but that they can rectify  Lake is getting help in her quest from Trump who posted on Truth Social Monday that Lake should be installed as governor of Arizona and baselessly claimed that she was the victim of a criminal voting operation involving broken voting machines in Republican districts drawing a parallel to his false claims about his own 2020 loss Lake became a key Trump ally during her campaign and she has been floated as a potential 2024 running mate for Trump who announced his candidacy just weeks ago  This is almost as bad as the 2020 Presidential Election which the Unselect Committee refuses to touch because they know it was Fraudulent he wrote  As to whether shes planning on abandoning her claims anytime soon Lake seemed to suggest she wont She wrote Monday that the Fake News ignores our Fake Elections and expects us to just move on We wont  Lake has long suggested she would challenge her loss  It was obvious well before Election Day that Lake intended to challenge the results if she lost  Ahead of Election Day Lake repeatedly dodged questions about whether she would concede the governors race if she lost saying Im going to win the election and I will accept that result and that shed only accept a fair honest and transparent result During the primary she said she would challenge the results if she lost because it would have indicated theres some cheating going on And before the race was called she suggested that Arizona election officials were intentionally dragging their feet on releasing the results while still declaring I am 100 going to win  Her comments were in line with her history of election denialism Lake has said that had she been governor at the time she wouldnt have certified the 2020 vote for Biden saying that it was Corrupt Rotten  Rigged She even filed a lawsuit which has since been dismissed by a federal judge that made false claims about issues with votecounting machines and sought to require Arizona officials to tabulate 2022 ballots by hand  Other electiondenying candidates such as the Arizona GOPs secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem similarly set up the expectation that they would challenge the election results Almost all of them ended up losing Abraham Hamadeh the GOP nominee for Arizona attorney general has argued that the election was afflicted with certain errors and inaccuracies but his race is heading to a recount Finchem has also yet to concede arguing as recently as Monday that the election should be recalled and that there should be a new election  Lakes refusal to concede could be strategic  The Arizona governors race made Lake a GOP star Its possible that her attempts to prolong the certification of the election in Arizona are just a ploy to maintain her national profile and create a launching pad for the next phase of her career political or otherwise  She ran an unconventional campaign eschewing traditional ad buys for viral campaign videos full of controversial statements that grabbed national headlines including comments that appeared to make light of the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosis husband All of that won her Trumps admiration and endorsement and praise from other prominent Republicans though she still proved a divisive figure within the party and might be even more so now that shes lost what seemed to be a winnable race  Kenneth L Khachigian Ronald Reagans former chief speechwriter waxed poetic in the Wall Street Journal last month What makes Ms Lakes message different is its simplicity and fearlessness Its unapologetic and sincere not clothed in code words Trump reportedly sees something of himself in Lake Even the current termlimited Gov Doug Ducey who accused Lake of misleading voters when he was backing Taylor Robson during the primary eventually warmed to her though he hasnt entertained her refusal to concede and called Hobbs to offer his congratulations  All the adulation from Republicans  and speculation that she might be a potential running mate for Trump even though she didnt win the

ServiceAP WNBA star and twotime Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner sits in the plane as she flies to Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates to be exchanged for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout on Dec 9 2022  These prisoners are US citizens Some have been detained on trumpedup charges Others have committed relatively minor offenses and been sentenced in trials no democracy would recognize as fair to long grueling confinement  Theyre effectively being held to political ransom  And in Ms Griners case President Biden decided to pay  He agreed to release Viktor Bout a notorious Russian arms dealer arrested in 2008 after being ensnared in a US sting operation He was sentenced to a 25year jail term for telling DEA agents he would sell arms to Colombian rebels adding he had no problem if they were used against Americans seeking to disrupt that countrys cocaine trade  In making the deal to free Ms Griner the president was clearly acting from a valuesbased impulse Indeed our thought experiment describes almost perfectly the arguments he would have made to himself colleagues and aides in deciding to pursue the deal  For critics however it was a decidedly unequal trade Russias merchant of death in return for a basketball player  But what has unsettled even some Biden supporters about his decision are the values tradeoffs it involved  The deal did not secure freedom for two other Americans still held in Russia Paul Whelan a former US Marine imprisoned on what both he and Washington say are invented charges of espionage or Marc Fogel a schoolteacher serving a 14year sentence for possession of a small quantity of medical marijuana prescribed in the US  And a more fundamental question is raising its awkward head Didnt agreeing to any deal whatever the terms risk encouraging Russia and other countries that have already seized Western nationals to engage in further hostage taking  This last concern will have resonated with allies as well  Alexander ZemlianichenkoAPFile Paul Whelan a former US marine who was arrested for alleged spying in Moscow Hopes that he would be freed along with WBNA star Brittney Griner in return for Viktor Bout the Russian arms dealer were dashed when only Ms Griner was let go  The Chinese government arrested two Canadian citizens in Beijing four years ago just days after Canada had detained Meng Wanzhou a top executive in the Chinese tech firm Huawei in line with a US extradition request The Canadians were held for nearly three years until the US Justice Department reached a deferred prosecution deal with Ms Meng allowing her and the Canadians to return home  And despite Mr Bidens efforts to include Mr Whelan in last weeks deal Russia conditioned his release on a Boutsize ransom from another ally Germany Moscow wanted the release of Vadim Krasikov serving a life sentence for the murder of a Chechen separatist in Berlin in 2021  something both the United States and Germany evidently agreed was a nonstarter  So in the end if Ms Griner was to be spared nine years in a Siberian penal colony the choice that President Biden felt he was left with was stark the Viktor Bout deal or no deal at all  That may of course be a

BankmanFried one of the most prominent effective altruists have exposed some of the problems with the thinking behind the philosophy and how its being practiced    One method at the center of effective altruism EA urges its followers to make as much money as possible so that they can devote a large part of their riches to helping humanity an idea called Earn to give  Advertisement  But while that mission might be purely altruistic theres another way of seeing it As a getoutofjailfree card to people who want to put vast wealth creation at the center of their lives It allows such people to ignore if they wish the fraying edges of the neoliberal order The widening gaps between rich and poor for instance or the destruction of the environment And while theyre giving away a lot of their wealth they arent doing it at the expense of personal luxury Not only does earn to give ignore the problems at the heart of the prevailing economic system it supercharges capitalism It hints that capitalism isnt only the best way to live or the only way to live but also a just way to live  EA carries a seductive message  EA holds that while we cant easily solve all the worlds problems we could certainly alleviate the greatest suffering if we chose wisely where to direct our efforts And certainly some of the efforts of EA have improved lives As of 2022 Against Malaria Foundation had received 58 million from Open Philanthropy an EAinfluenced funder founded by Dustin Moskovitz a cofounder of Facebook and his wife the former journalist Cari Tuna Providing deworming medicine for children in poor countries has been put on the agenda and funded in large part by effective altruists Theres nothing glitzy about these causes Here money effected real change    The ideological fountainhead of EA is William MacAskill who as a philosophy undergraduate at Oxford in 2009 formed his first ideas about how to do the most good possible MacAskills thesis led to the formation of several organizations including the Centre for Effective Altruism MacAskill has written several books about the movement In them he advances another central idea  longtermism a framework of thought in which effective altruists weigh the good they can do by adding up the number of people who benefitnot just those alive today but also those yet to be born In that calculation speculative worries about the futuresuch as the risks of rogue AIcan trump clear and present dangers like cholera or deforestation    A conversation between MacAskill and BankmanFried is credited with propelling the FTX founder into his subsequent career in trading and then cryptocurrency MacAskill also worked for BankmanFrieds charitable enterprises After FTXs collapse MacAskill tweeted that he will have much to reflect on if it turns out FTX misused funds He didnt respond to a request for comment from   Advertisement  Whats the future for EA  The collapse of FTX raises practical and moral questions about the uncertain future of EA If taking huge risksfor example with other peoples moneyleads to huge financial gains for good causes are those risks justified Are they justified so long as they pay offresulting in massive charitable giving saybut unjustified when they dont  Advertisement  There are other signs of cracks and divisions within EA Scholars like Carla Zoe Cremer at Oxford have raised the concern that many of EAs greatest beneficiaries are other EA organizations Theyve also flagged that those receiving funding from effective altruists may be scared to criticize EA lest they lose support Finally there is a tension between longtermism and helping people today with the movement as a whole potentially leaning towards speculative futureproofing even as some call for the mitigation of suffering that is actually already taking place  Whats the alternative to EA  The challenge of how to do good is a huge one Freemarket capitalism hasnt delivered The worlds poor are now subject to the worst of climate change brought about by rapacious development and consumerism by the rich As a result many thinkers have proposed that we move beyond traditional capitalism to something more communal which takes into account all the stakeholders along a long and complex chain  Advertisement  But earn to give promises something else If our goal is to earn as much as we possibly can it

rights Jenna Hanes a spokesperson for Council member José Chito Vela the lead sponsor of the Austin resolution said in a statement  Inspired by a 2020 measure limiting the use of city and police

residents consider to be important Ms Hanes wrote  But in the eyes of Rebecca Parma senior legislative associate at antiabortion Texas Right to Life Austins City Council is trying to flout state law

migrants a ruling that could block the main tool the Biden administration has used to manage an unprecedented migration wave along the USMexico border  In an earlier ruling on Tuesday Judge Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia voided an order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC that has allowed US border officials to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants on public health grounds saying the edict was not properly enacted  First issued in 2020 by the Trump administration at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic the Title 42 policy relies on a late 19th century law designed to stop the introduction of contagious diseases in the US Migrants processed under Title 42 are not allowed to request US asylum and are instead summarily expelled from the country  Tuesdays ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU which has argued that Title 42 places migrants in harms way and violates US asylum law Migrants on US soil including those who cross the border illegally are permitted to request humanitarian protection  This ruling is of enormous significance for asylumseekers and will hopefully put an end to the misuse of public health laws to block desperate people from seeking protection Lee Gelernt the ACLU lawyer who filed the lawsuit told   Later on Tuesday Biden administration lawyers asked Sullivan to pause his ruling for five weeks citing operational concerns about abruptly ending Title 42 and the need for an orderly transition to regular immigration processing  This transition period is critical to ensuring that DHS can continue to carry out its mission to secure the Nations borders and to conduct its border operations in an orderly fashion the Justice Department lawyers wrote referring to the Department of Homeland Security  Sullivan granted the Biden administrations request on Wednesday He wrote that he did so WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE because the ACLU did not oppose it and because the government said it was designed to make operational adjustments to comply with his ruling Sullivan said his order halting Title 42 would take effect on Dec 21 at midnight  Border patrol agents talk to a group of migrants taken from Tijuana Baja California state Mexico on Nov 11 2022 GUILLERMO ARIASAFP via Getty Images  In his 49page opinion on Tuesday Sullivan said he determined the Title 42 policy was arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law that governs regulations He said the CDC failed to properly explain the rationale for authorizing an unprecedented expulsion authority as opposed to implementing less drastic measures to mitigate COVID concerns such as vaccinations and monoclonal antibodies  Sullivan also said the CDC failed to consider the harm to migrants subject to expulsion citing reports warning that migrants could be persecuted or otherwise victimized in Mexico and elsewhere after being expelled from the US  It is unreasonable for the CDC to assume that it can ignore the consequences of any actions it chooses to take in the pursuit of fulfilling its goals particularly when those actions included the extraordinary decision to suspend the codified procedural and substantive rights of noncitizens seeking safe harbor Sullivan wrote  After continuing the expulsions for over a year the Biden administration in April announced Title 42s termination citing improving pandemic conditions But through a separate lawsuit a coalition of Republicanled states convinced a federal judge in Louisiana to stop the termination  While it appealed that ruling the Biden administration has continued to heavily rely on Title 42 as a border management policy amid record numbers of migrant apprehensions along the southern border It also recently expanded the border expulsions to deter Venezuelan migrants from entering the US unlawfully  In fiscal year 2022 which ended on Sept 30 US officials along the southern border stopped migrants nearly 24 million times the highest annual tally on record Over 1 million of those encounters with migrants resulted in them being expelled under Title 42 federal statistics show  On paper Title 42 applies to both land borders with Canada and Mexico and migrants of all nationalities but it has mainly been used along the southern border to turn back Mexican and Central American migrant adults to Mexico or Central Americas Northern Triangle region made up by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador  For diplomatic and logistical reasons the US has not used Title 42 on a large scale to expel migrants of other nationalities One exception was an air expulsion blitz to Haiti in the fall of 2021 following the sudden arrival of thousands of Haitian migrants to Del Rio Texas  For over two years Mexico only allowed the US to expel Mexican and Central American migrants to its territory But in October Mexico announced it would accept expulsions of Venezuelans as part of a broader strategy that included the US agreeing to allow up to 24000 Venezuelans to enter the country legally  While the Trump and Biden administrations have both portrayed the Title 42 policy as a tool to reduce coronavirus outbreaks in border holding facilities its public health rationale has been contested by public health experts including CDC officials who objected to the policy being implemented', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

to be concerned about climate change  Thats according to postelection research from Tufts University And its part of a national trend that shows voters younger than 30 helped turn the tide for Democrats in key swing states and blunt an expected Republican wave in the midterm elections  Youth are increasing their electoral participation leading movements and making their voices heard on key issues that affect their communities according to analysis from Tufts Universitys Center for Information  Research on Civic Learning and Engagement  Overall 27 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 turned out for the midterms the secondhighest percentage on record according to the Tufts University data But that number rose to 31 percent in key swing states including Florida Michigan North Carolina New Hampshire Nevada Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsinand Georgia  Warnock won 494 percent of the overall vote in this months midterm elections compared to 485 percent for Walker Georgia election rules require a runoff if no candidate breaks the 50 percent threshold  Young Georgians accounted for 116000 votes of Warnocks total share according to Tufts Thats almost three times the margin of his edge over Walker  In Georgia young voters were about 13 percent of the electorate higher than any other swing state won by Democrats Tufts found They voted for Warnock over Walker by about 2 to 1  Young people are more likely than any other voting bloc to be concerned about climate policy polling has long shown  To move any young person out of their apartment and into the voting booth the candidate has to be relying on issues related to climate change I think its just kind of table stakes said John Della Volpe director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and author of Fight How Gen Z is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America  The Tufts analysis found that more than 8 in 10 young midterm voters said climate was a very serious or somewhat serious issue  In Georgia young votersespecially voters of colorare highly motivated by climate policy said Sara Suzuki a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts who helped analyze the results  Not running on climate more seriously is a missed opportunity she said Communities of color are feeling climate issues more acutely and that helps explain why young people of color are really prioritizing climate as an issue  In the Georgia Senate race the two candidates are on the opposite ends of the climate policy spectrum  Climate and clean energy policy already is proving to be a jobs creator Last month Hyundai opened a 55 billion electricvehicle and battery plant in Georgia that will create 8000 jobs Georgia is also ranked seventh in the country for solar installation according to the Solar Energy Industries Association  Warnock attended the groundbreaking for the plant in Savannah alongside Republican Gov Brian Kemp He told reporters that climate policy is a moral issue and then touted his green credentials  Ive also put forward a lot of legislation focused on creating a green energy future everything from electric vehicles to electric batteries being manufactured in the state to investing in solar manufacturing he said  By contrast Walker said last week that the United States isnt ready for more renewable energy  Were not prepared were not ready right now he said What we need to do is keep having those gasguzzling cars We got the good emissions under those cars  It will take another few weeks before more comprehensive exit polling data is finished but the early midterm results show climate was a motivating factor for many voters  The Associated Press VoteCast found that inflation and the economy dominated voter concernsand that about half of voters said it was their top concern No other issue came close but about 10 percent of voters listed other issues as their top concern including climate abortion health care and gun policy  Young voters had the secondhighest rate of voting in any midterm second only to the 2018 midterms during former President Donald Trumps term  In fact Generation Z and millennial voters under 30 voted in such a large number that they canceled out every voter 65 and older according to Della Volpe who has overseen Harvards youth polling since 2000 That effectively decided the fate of the election because young people overwhelmingly voted in favor of Democrats at 63 percent with 35 percent voting for Republicans he found  Millennials and members of the Z generation have now delivered three elections in a row for Democrats he said By 2024 they will account for nearly 40 percent of votes Della Volpe noted  Young voters want to support candidates who share their values and who acknowledge that climate change presents significant challenges to their generation If a candidates position does not align with climate science does not align with a young persons perspective Im not sure there is anything that candidate can do to win that voters support Its essential Della Volpe said  There was evidence of the power of the youth vote in races across the country particularly in the closest races  In the Arizona governors race Democrat Katie Hobbs eked out a narrow victory of about 20000 votes over Republican Kari Lake Young voters accounted for about 60000 votes in the state according to Tufts estimates  In Nevada Democratic Sen Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection over Republican Adam Laxalt securing Democratic control of the Senate by 9000 votes Young people accounted for a net 28000 votes Tufts found  In Pennsylvania and Arizona young voters overwhelmingly voted for the Democrats Pennsylvania Lt Gov John Fetterman D received 70 percent of their vote compared to Republican Mehmet Ozs 28 percent In Arizona incumbent Democratic Sen Mark Kelly received 76 percent of the young vote compared to the 20 percent received by Republican Blake Masters  For a long time young voters have been counted out said Jack Lobel deputy communications director for Voters of Tomorrow a youth voting organization But Democrats have made tangible progress on a number of their issues in the last two years he said Passing a major climate bill and working to protect abortion rights while addressing student loan debt motivated young people to go vote  Clearly the will of young voters was to elect people who are thinking about our future and I think thats especially apparent on issues of climate change he said President Biden definitely moved the needle with voters on the Inflation Reduction Act Its a symbol

       " {'guid': 8812, 'text_a': '   Political leaders are generally at their strongest the moment they take office  Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is far from assured of winning sufficient support in his party to become House speaker next month But even before the vote his authority is already weakening by the day  in a way that could make him a speaker who is in office but not in power  The tiny GOP House majority that takes over in January after a disappointing midterm performance would mean a fragile governing mandate for any party at any point in American history And the ideological struggle being waged by proDonald Trump extremists inside the party would have made even a more comfortable majority volatile  But the compromises that McCarthy is facing in his increasingly bitter campaign for the speakership threaten to leave him as a tool of the most radical members of his conference and could diminish his capacity to hold the job in the long term  The California Republican is fighting a rearguard battle against members who want to make it easier to eject a sitting speaker and hes appeasing exPresident Donald Trumps extremism and that of acolytes like Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene to save a narrow political power base propping up his dream of running the House  Once an avuncular and smoothtalking GOP rising star McCarthy has adopted some of the confrontational defiance of the Make America Great Again movement seeming to seek out soundbite clashes with the press as badges of honor  Given that he can only afford to lose four votes to be elected speaker  and then to pass legislation  it would take a political genius to corral the GOP conference While McCarthy is broadly popular among Republican lawmakers and is a prodigious fundraiser nothing so far in his career suggests he is a leader of that caliber In fact he seems less of a heavyweight than former GOP Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan who were driven out of politics by the impossibility of running a riotous Republican majority  If politics is the art of the possible McCarthy is acting in a way that is most likely to allow him to reach power  even if the speakers gavel might turn into a poisoned chalice and require him to infringe democratic values to keep it  But his struggle to lock in the speakership and his possible futile future mission of amassing a governing majority amount to more than an insideWashington brouhaha or internal GOP feud If the House cannot pass spending bills or if radical members of the Republican conference try to hold McCarthy hostage the economic and social consequences could soon affect tens of millions of Americans Government shutdowns budget showdowns and an impasse over raising US borrowing limits could severely damage the US economy the militarys readiness and the dollars reputation as a reserve currency  This is one reason why the current yearend tussle over whether to fund the government for a full year  a bipartisan framework agreement for which was announced Tuesday night  or for just a few months is so critical since it could dump a fiscal crisis on the lap of a weak and easily manipulated new speaker next month  McCarthys impossible math  From a broader political perspective it might be in McCarthys interest to stand up to the most extreme members of his conference The path to the GOP majority went through comparatively moderate seats in places like New York that will be most at risk in the 2024 election And proTrump electiondenying extremists like those who are tormenting him now were mostly rejected by swingstate voters in the midterm elections The antiTrump vote was also decisive in the 2018 election when Republicans lost the House and in 2020 when they lost the presidency  So showing voters in 2024 that GOP governance addressed key problems like inflation and the economy will be important But while he has announced he will form a select committee to examine Chinas growing threat which could unite both parties most of McCarthys recent rhetoric has focused on a relentless set of investigations of the Biden administration and conservatives interest in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas  The GOP leaders attitude is easily explained The nature of the House with its twoyear terms and gerrymandered districts means McCarthys lawmakers are easily radicalized with the greatest threat to their jobs often coming from more extreme opponents in primaries And while he is clearly catering to the most zealous members of his conference the House GOP as a whole is extremely conservative Two years ago a majority of Republican lawmakers including McCarthy voted against certifying Joe Bidens election win despite the absence of any credible claims of fraud and after the desecration of Congress by Trumps mob  The steps McCarthy is taking to try to secure the speakership  and the future complications that may entail  were evident on Tuesday when he gave Greene the Georgia Republican a pass for her latest effort to mock the trauma of the Capitol insurrection The congresswoman had said over the weekend that had she been in charge on January 6 2021 the riot would have succeeded and the mob would have been armed She later insisted she was being sarcastic after the White House complained her comments were a slap in the face to law enforcement and against fundamental US values  Asked by s Manu Raju on Tuesday about Greenes latest inflammatory comments McCarthy shrugged them off Oh I think she said she was being facetious the possible future speaker answered His attitude was not a surprise it was consistent with his attempts to rewrite the history of the worst attack on US democracy in modern times for which he briefly said Trump bore responsibility  But it also reflected Greenes growing personal power after she broke with some radical GOP members and lined up to support McCarthys speakership After coming to Congress as a fringe figure and quickly losing her committee assignments over her past retweets of violent rhetoric against Democrats Greene now promises to be one of the most prominent faces of the new GOP majority That she has the latitude to make what to many people are offensive and insurrectionist comments without any fear of rebuke from her partys leader says a lot about her position And it also shows that while Trumps power may be waning elsewhere after a lackluster launch of his 2024 campaign his influence over his followers in the House like Greene remains strong  The same dynamic was at play when McCarthy declined to directly criticize the expresident for meeting with white supremacist Nick Fuentes at a dinner also featuring Kanye West the rapper now known as Ye who has recently made a string of antisemitic remarks In a histrionic performance at the White House after meeting Biden and other congressional leaders last month the House Republican leader falsely claimed that Trump had condemned Fuentes four times when he hadnt done so once  How the current spending fight is being shaped by McCarthys speaker bid  McCarthys hardening opposition towards a yearend spending bill in the lame duck Congress also shows that he understands that without indulging his most ideological colleagues he may never become speaker  s Raju and Melanie Zanona reported Tuesday that McCarthy had signaled at the White House meeting that hed be open to a large bill But while Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell worked on such a measure Tuesday and declared it broadly appealing McCarthy told his members that he was a Hell no on the measure  The split not only augurs likely future tensions between Republicans in the House and McConnell it raises the possibility that it will become politically more difficult for some Republican senators to vote for a spending deal now  especially as conservative media has taken up McCarthys line  A shortterm fix that takes the issue into early next year could provoke a gargantuan showdown with the White House in the first days of GOP control of the House with members firmly committed to slashing Bidens spending plans and domestic agenda Even though that would be a high risk for McCarthy that could backfire with a national electorate setting up the possibility of such a confrontation might be one way to shore up his vote in the speakership campaign  Still given that Democrats should be able to pass a broader funding deal in the final days of their majority McCarthys opposition could win him points with no longterm consequence  a potentially useful political situation This became more likely on Tuesday when Senate Republicans and Democrats and House Democrats announced the framework agreement on an omnibus appropriations bill  One thing the California Republican does have going for his dreams of the top job is the fact that there so far is not a strong alternative to his candidacy GOP Rep Andy Biggs of Arizona the former head of the Freedom Caucus has launched a longshot bid  But McCarthy faces a nervous holiday season  On Tuesday Raju asked him to comment on a claim by Florida Republican Rep Matt Gaetz that he will never hit the 218vote threshold  Do you believe Gaetz or do you believe me he replied  That there is even a question over whether the words of the supposedly most powerful Republicantobe in Washington or a renegade member carry more currency reflects McCarthys diminished authority  and highlights the risk that if he does have a speakership it could be a weak one', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

distance and the taunts of the enemy are silenced Hey soldier Do you know whos in command here asks Willard Yeah answers the Roach before walking away  That scene typifies the vibe right now on Twitter in the best possible way  Following Twitters purchase by Elon Musk there is a sense that anything can happen  and that it just might On Thursday the rumor was going around that it might be Twitters last day Musk issued an ultimatum to Twitters apparently entitled staff  at least one worker was surprised to be let go for publicly insulting Musk  that the work going forward would be hardcore Those who desired to stay would need to affirmatively respond to Musks email When few employees took him up on the offer Musk had everyone locked out of the building This along with a mass wave of resignations contributed to the perception that Twitter lacked critical engineers in nearly every area of operation and could soon be gone I exchanged halfjoking goodbyes with some of my Twitter pals  But when Friday morning came Twitter was still there Really glad I didnt freak out last night and post this one terrific picture I have of my boobs cracked one user I am friendly with Another friend posted that if Twitter is nearing its end at least we spent its final hours making fun of sanctimonious liberals  And sanctimonious they are Aaron Rupar a smug lefty influencer took the battle metaphor a bit too literally excoriating a fellow liberal Twitter user for stolen valor The users crime He had posted a One America News Network clip Rupar had posted the same video earlier in the day and felt he deserved credit merely for being the first to post something that wasnt his How dare he take what you rightfully stole quipped one of my Twitter friends  Rupars use of the phrase stolen valor was telling These people really do believe they are engaged in a brave act of resistance JoJoFromJerz an influencer who was at least until recently a teacher likes to shriek to no one in particular that she will not allow Musk to drive her off the platform as if he knows and cares who she is Naturally she and Rupar along with a gaggle of other loweffort liberal trolls were recent guests at the Biden White House  Activist Andrew Wortman username AMoneyResists  resists what recently griped of Musk He fired ¾ of the employees Now hes planning to starve the rest of them Hes failure incarnate This in response to a report that Musk would start requiring Twitters employees  all adults at least in the chronological sense  to pay for lunch at the previously free cafeteria And lest you think the tantrums are isolated to boutique influencers CBS News just announced that out of an abundance of caution they will stop using Twitter while they monitor what is occurring on the app  Musk has committed two great sins in the eyes of the left The first is that he is supposedly a fascist because he does not believe in deplatforming figures over speech In practice this might mean that he allows Donald Trump back onto Twitter He has disrupted the lefts relative chokehold on what is considered allowable speech on social media But fascism Musk himself tweeted that Twitters new policy is freedom of speech but not freedom of reach Hate tweets wont be found unless users seek them out Musk said which is no different from the rest of the internet This should hardly be controversial  Musks second transgression is that he is supposedly not competent enough to run Twitter Its hard to say whether this is true Musk has axed a lot of longtime employees but Twitter is bleeding money He was derided for a new scheme to sell the coveted blue checkmarks indicating verified accounts but it got people talking about the app By Musks own admission Twitter will do stupid things in the coming days and take chances He is acting as a tech disruptor an archetype once beloved by the left Its hardly believable that a man who is spearheading private space travel is failure incarnate as Wortman called him even if he cant make Twitter work  Twitter under Musk is certainly no worse than the alternatives Some on the left have insisted they will decamp to ersatz versions of Twitter like Mastodon But as the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently complained Mastodon is basically unusable  Maybe Twitter will still be here tomorrow Maybe it wont The difference between enjoying that uncertainty and despairing over it is how seriously you take your time on social media Twitter is a good place to get news and even make new friends But unlike those who have memed themselves into believing they are a brave resistance my friends dont fret about the future of democracy in a world without the worlds seventeenthlargest social media network  Bill Zeiser writes

shared a passion for bigoted publicity stunts and happily heckled Joe Biden together at the State of the Union But their friendship appears to be crumbling  Boebert took a surprising swipe at Greene during an interview on Monday when asked whether she would support House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthys bid to become House speaker in the next Congress as her longtime ally Greene does Boebert balked at the question Well you know Ive been aligned with Marjorie and accused of believing a lot of the things that she believes in I dont believe in this just like I dont believe in Russian space lasers Jewish space lasers and all of this she said to laughter from her audience before explaining the conditions on which shed personally back McCarthy  Boebert and Greene are choosing different paths as they reckon with different costs and benefits of their diverging experiences with rightwing populism  Boebert was not just mocking Greenes antisemitic conspiracy theory posted in 2018 speculating that Rothschildbacked space lasers cause wildfires she was signaling that she doesnt want to be grouped together with Greene anymore  Greene was swift to strike back On Twitter she scoffed at Boeberts slim margin of victory in her reelection and lamented that Boebert childishly threw me under the bus for a cheap sound bite Greene also accused Boebert of turning her back on McCarthy Trump and Greene herself despite their support for her  Greene slammed Boebert for engaging in high school drama but in reality their row runs deeper than personal tension The emerging fissures shed light on the dilemmas the MAGA right faces in this political moment Boebert and Greene are choosing different paths as they reckon with different costs and benefits of their diverging experiences with rightwing populism  Right now Greene is feeling good She comfortably won reelection in her deepred Georgia district and paid no penalty for her affiliation with the QAnon conspiracy theory or white supremacist Nick Fuentes She has little reason to consider her fringe views a political liability  Somewhat counterintuitively Greene also has a stake in backing the status quo when it comes to supporting McCarthy as he goes up for a vote to become House speaker in January Despite her bombthrowing political extremism Greene has developed a mutually beneficial relationship with McCarthy McCarthy is a political opportunist who likely sees her status as a powerful fundraiser and a political celebrity who can get the base riled up as good for the party  And there are signs that Greene has extracted some promises from McCarthy as he scrambles to get the support he needs to become speaker  a vote during which he can afford no more than four defections from within his party Shortly after Greene took office Democrats stripped her of her committee assignments after reports emerged showing that she endorsed a call for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be killed It appears that McCarthy not only plans on allowing her to rejoin committees but on giving her important ones and possibly one that will allow her to sit front and center in investigating the Biden administration  By contrast Boebert is  not feeling so good As of last spring she already appeared to be objecting to some of Greenes most extreme views they reportedly looked as if they were about to come to literal blows during an argument after Greene had attended one of Fuentes events And Boebert likely now views her affiliation with the most extreme elements of MAGA world as politically dangerous after nearly being ousted from office by a Democrat in her conservative Colorado district She won reelection by a little over 500 votes  MAGA ideology continues to live in Congress but its also growing more complicated  Boebert has not expressed any kind of wholesale reevaluation of MAGA ideology but its clear she is picking her political battles more carefully and could be hesitant to lean into controversy the way Greene continues to relish  Boebert seems to be threading the needle with her current position on McCarthy Shes said that shell back him for speaker if he revives a rule that would make it easier for lawmakers to oust a speaker from their position during their term Its a strategic posture because it allows her to stake out a rebellious position gives her and her farright colleagues more opportunities to kick McCarthy out of leadership if they feel moved to assuming he agrees to the rule change and it allows her to present herself as someone who is willing to compromise rather than take the hardline no to McCarthy position of a few of her MAGA colleagues  Greene and Boebert might have more in common than not But theyre learning different lessons from the past couple of years and they have diverging interests going forward MAGA ideology continues to live in Congress but its also growing more complicated', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

       " {'guid': 9434, 'text_a': 'On Friday President Joe Biden asked the United States Supreme Court to revive his administrations studentloan relief plan shortly after a lower court ruled it was illegal  The announcement which was expected presents a unique test for the conservative majority which finds itself in a partisan deadlock between the Democratic administration and the cadre of conservative groups who oppose the program  While the Supreme Court has twice denied efforts to challenge the Biden administration programsaying the plaintiffs lacked standing in the casethe court now finds itself facing a new scenario namely a decision by a lower appeals court that the cancellation of federal borrowers student debt potentially jeopardizes statelevel lending programs in states like Nebraska one of the leaders of the pending suit  What comes next is now an open question  The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has a clear bias toward the administrative statein this case the Biden Administration and its decision to unilaterally suspend borrowers federal student loan debts  However the administration has argued the ongoing COVID19 emergency declaration in place gives it broad leeway to enact programs like student debt cancellation under the precedent established under the HEROES Act which permitted myriad social spending programs including the Biden administrations decision to pause student loan debt repayments to offset the economic fallout of the pandemic  So far several lower courts have agreed with them And to this point the actual merits of the casewhether the student debt plan challenges state sovereigntyhave not yet been broached in a court of law leaving room for the Supreme Court to decide whether states base complaint is valid or whether it should be thrown out  How they might rule however is difficult to discern  It would be difficult to predict how the Justices would rule on something as tricky as standing especially given that each of the relevant States presents different theories about how they are injured Sheng Li an attorney at the New Civil Liberties Alliance who authored an amicus brief challenging the debt relief program wrote  in an email Justice Barret twice turned away in Brown County and Garrison requests for Supreme Court review of studentloan cases that were dismissed for lack of standing In other words her likely views on the merits of the studentloan cancellation policy did not affect her conclusion on the need for standing  If the states do have standing however things could get interesting While the federal government is still operating under an emergency declaration due to the COVID19 pandemic University of Alabama law professor Luke Herrinewho has written a book supporting the executive branchs authority to cancel student loan debtsuggested the court could potentially examine whether the country is still in an emergency and from there evaluate whether the administration acted outside of its authority in canceling federal student loan debt without the consent of Congress  In that question Herrine said the federal government has some legs to stand onthough it could run into trouble up against the conservative members of the courts principled opposition to the administrative state  The federal government has a very clear argument and theyve put forward evidence for it Herrine said in an interview You might agree or disagree with it but the bottom line is they said Look we have all this evidence that restarting payments increases default rates and therefore people would be made worse off by pausing their payments in the middle of an emergency and restarting them without relieving some debt  Li however says there is already clear precedent supporting overturning Bidens student loan debt cancellation plan under last terms West Virginia v EPA case which ruled the agency did not have the authority to unilaterally regulate carbon emissions by forcing existing power plants to transition from fuels like coal or natural gas to other less noxious power sources  Assuming they find standing to exist the six Justices in the majority of last terms West Virginia v EPA decision Justices Robert Thomas Alito Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Barret likely would conclude the debtcancellation program violates the Constitutions separation of powers Li wrote  Some liberal justices added Li could also be swayed to overturn the Biden program over their previous decisions supporting Congress authority over the budget  They may be joined by one or more Justices in the West Virginia minority because the debtcancellation program involves the Executive Branch attempting to usurp Congresss power of the purse and thus presents a more serious separationofpowers problem than the EPAs policy in the West Virginia case Justice Elena Kagan has been willing to rule against federal agencies that flagrantly violate the separation of powers  Notably wrote Li Kagan

are designated as classified  additional materials released Monday as part of the Twitter Files part seven suggest the FBI was extensively involved in crafting the Russian disinformation narrative to kill the Hunter Biden laptop story  The Latest  Heads up FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan opened an Oct 13 2020 lateevening email to Yoel Roth the thenhead of site integrity for Twitter Chans email alerted him to a Teleporter link that would allow Roth to download 10 documents It is not spam Chan stressed asking Roth to confirm receipt of the link Two minutes later at 624 pm California time Roth acknowledged he had received the message and downloaded the files  Chans Oct 13 2020 email was one of several internal communications published Monday by Michael Shellenberger in his thread on part seven of the Twitter Files While the email contained no further details about the content of the 10 documents provided to the top Twitter executive that Chan sent the email the evening before the New York Posts story on the Hunter Biden laptop hit and mere hours after a lawyer for the Biden son had contacted John Paul Mac Isaac the owner of the computer repair store where Hunter had abandoned his laptop proves suggestive  That the email came after normal business hours via the private oneway communications channel used by the FBI and included an alert to Roth to watch for the communication all also indicate that the message and the attached 10 documents concerned a matter of urgency And what could be more urgent than the laptop October surprise  By 9something in the morning of Oct 14 2020 Jim Baker the nowformer deputy general counsel of Twitter had already seen some reliable cybersecurity folks question the authenticity of the emails as he told Roth and 11 other colleagues in an email The formatting looks like they could be complete fabrications Baker explained Another email also showed Baker had arranged a phone conversation with Matthew Perry in the FBIs Office of General Counsel for that same day  For his part by 1000 am Roth wrote some 15plus colleagues that they had decided to block the Posts Hunter Biden story as hacked material explaining that a key factor informing our approach is consensus from experts monitoring election security and disinformation that this looks a lot like a hackandleak that learned from the 2016 Wikileaks approach and our policy changes  The suggestion from experts  which rings true Roth continued is there was a hack that happened separately and they loaded the hacked materials on the laptop that magically appeared at a repair shop in Delaware and was coincidentally reviewed in a very invasive way by someone who coincidentally then handed the materials to Rudy Giuliani  Those reliable cybersecurity folks and experts monitoring election security and disinformation of which Baker and Roth spoke might not have been connected to the FBI or the documents Chan sent the prior evening But if they are which seems possible  if not likely  the evidence implicating the FBI in lying to interfere in the 2020 election just multiplied exponentially  Prior to Mondays Twitter Files dump Roth acknowledged in a statement to the Federal Election Commission that since 2018 he had regular meetings with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence the Department of Homeland Security the FBI and industry peers regarding election security During these weekly meetings the federal law enforcement agencies communicated that they expected hackandleak operations by state actors might occur in the period shortly before the 2020 presidential election likely in October Roth said Roth further explained that from those meetings he learned that there were rumors that a hackandleak operation would involve Hunter Biden  Facebooks founder Mark Zuckerberg likewise confirmed during an interview with Joe Rogan that the tech giants decision to censor the Hunter Biden story stemmed from the FBI basically telling his team Hey just so you know you should be on high alert We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election Zuckerberg recalled the FBI warning his tech company adding that the agency told them We have it on notice that basically theres about to be some kind of dump similar to that so just be vigilant  So when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story on Oct 14 2020 Zuckerberg noted Facebook treated the story as potentially misinformation important misinformation for five to seven days while the tech giants team could determine whether it was false  Of course the Hunter Biden laptop story was not false and was not part of a hackandleak operation and the FBI knew it having seized the laptop from Mac Isaac in December of 2019 Thus these statements from Roth and Zuckerberg establish the FBI lied to the tech giants prompting them to censor the New York Posts reporting and thereby interfere in the election  Roth and Zuckerbergs statements should be enough to cement the FBIs peddling of false intel to interfere in a presidential election as one of our nations worst political scandals But if the FBIs Oct 13 2020 Teleporter message and documents provide further concrete evidence that the FBI fed Twitter the opinion of supposed experts that the laptop was hacked or fake it will be difficult for even the propaganda press to keep ignoring the story  Its Classified  Unfortunately Shellenberger references neither the underlying Teleporter message from Oct 13 2020 nor the content of the 10 documents Matt Taibbi  who in his coverage of part six of the Twitter Files on Friday also referenced a Chan email from Oct 16 2020 directing two highlevel Twitter executives to monitor their Teleporter messages for two important documents  likewise did not make any mention of the content of the Teleporter message or the two important documents attached Why is that  Another email released in Shellenbergers thread on Monday provides a clue  On July 15 2020 Chan wrote to Roth and another individual at Twitter whose identity was redacted In that email Chan proposed 30 days out from the election providing Twitter temporary clearances with Roth and his colleague picking who would receive clearances And by Sept 15 2020 the FBI was adamant that no impediments to information sharing exist including of classified information  Given that Taibbi and Shellenberger make no mention of the content of the Teleporter messages and attachments and given that Teleporter served as a oneway communications system from the FBI it seems likely the FBI used Teleporter to transmit classified materials to the select Twitter employees provided temporary security clearance That possibility would also account for the cryptic way Baker and Roth describe the supposed experts view of the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop to other Twitter employees who likely lacked clearance  So once again it appears the FBI will hide behind classification markings

finance minister in response to a budget that sparked markets chaos Daniel LealPool Photo via AP  Britains Prime Minister Liz Truss attends a press conference in the Downing Street Briefing Room in central London Friday Oct 14 2022 following the sacking of the finance minister in response to a budget that sparked markets chaos Daniel LealPool Photo via AP  LONDON AP  Embattled British Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked her Treasury chief and reversed course on a major part of her taxcutting economic plan Friday as she struggled to hang on to her job after weeks of turmoil on financial markets But the market response was muted and the political reaction to what many saw as panicked moves left Truss credibility in tatters after only six weeks in office  At a hastily arranged news conference Truss said she was acting to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline by ditching her pledge to scrap a planned increase in corporation tax Earlier she fired her close friend Kwasi Kwarteng as head of the Treasury and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt a longtime lawmaker who has served three previous stints as a Cabinet minister  Truss is trying to restore confidence and rebuild her credibility with international investors and members of her own party after the minibudget she and Kwarteng unveiled three weeks ago sparked political and economic turmoil  ADVERTISEMENT  The governments Sept 23 announcement that it planned to cut taxes by 45 billion pounds 50 billion without detailing how it would pay for them or offering independent analysis about the impact on public finances raised concerns that government borrowing could rise to unsustainable levels  That sent the pound plunging to a record low against the dollar and forced the Bank of England to step in to prevent a wider economic crisis  Truss has now canceled about 20 billion pounds of the originally planned tax cuts  But her brief downbeat news conference is unlikely to have reassured Truss Conservative Party that she is in control  I think shes just confirmed that shes not the right person for the job said Tim Bale professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London I dont think it communicated the kind of confidence the country needs right now  Despite backtracking on a major part of her program Truss clung to the idea that her policies were what the country needs to spur economic growth She also avoided repeated questions about why she should remain in office when she and Kwarteng were equally responsible for the governments economic plan and the fallout it triggered  ADVERTISEMENT  I am absolutely determined to see through what I have promised Truss said  The initial response from investors suggested Truss moves may not be enough to calm financial markets  Yields on 10year government bonds rose immediately after her news conference indicating investors are still concerned about government debt The pound fell 12 against the US dollar  The next big test for Truss will come Monday when trading resumes on financial markets The Bank of England on Friday ended its emergency intervention to stabilize longterm bond prices and protect pensions funds  Whether or not she remains prime minister her whole agenda now her ability to pursue her political project if you like is really out of her hands said Jill Rutter a senior fellow at the Institute for Government a Londonbased think tank  ADVERTISEMENT  Her fate is now in the hands of the markets  Truss is also facing pressure from across the political spectrum  The opposition Liberal Democrats called for an emergency weekend session of the House of Commons for Hunt to provide more detail on the governments economic plan Scotlands first minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an early general election And the BBC reported that a group of senior Conservative lawmakers are planning to call for Truss resignation next week  Truss future is in doubt less than six weeks after she took office promising to reenergize the British economy and put the nation on a path to longterm success  A smallstate lowtax Conservative who patterns herself after 1980s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Truss argued that cutting taxes reducing red tape and courting investment would spur economic growth and generate more revenue to pay for public services  But the Sept 23 tax cut plan only provided half of the equation Without an independent analysis of her full economic program the added growth it will produce and the additional tax revenue likely to be created she was asking investors and voters to trust that the sums would in the end add up  ADVERTISEMENT  Truss said Friday that Hunt would unveil the full economic plan on Oct 31 along with analysis from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility  James Athey investment director at the fund manager abrdn described Truss move as a Uturn on its decision not to Uturn on its profligate taxcutting policies And Britain still faces myriad problems he said  Inflation is at multidecade highs government borrowing is huge as is the current account deficit The housing market is likely to suffer a hammer blow from the jump in mortgage rates and the war in Ukraine rumbles on he said  We may well be through the worst of the volatility but I fear that the UK is nowhere near out of the woods  Conservative lawmakers are agonizing over whether to try to oust their second leader this year Truss was elected last month to replace Boris Johnson who was forced out in July  ADVERTISEMENT  The weeks of financial turmoil has helped the opposition Labour Party take a commanding lead in opinion polls A national election does not have to be held until 2024 but many Conservatives fear the party is running out of time to close the gap  Fractious Conservative lawmakers are scrambling to find a unity candidate who could replace Truss with speculation centering on Hunt and two of the rivals who lost to Truss in the summer leadership contest Rishi Sunak and

accept from Pyongyang  Tuesdays agreement included a commitment by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but the terms verifiable and irreversible were conspicuously absent from the document It failed to explicitly define the scope of denuclearization and didnt outline how North Korea might go about achieving it  Speaking to reporters a few hours after the signing

toward a peace regime on the peninsula Oba told  in an email referring to similar promises made by Kim in April during his landmark meeting with South Korean President Moon Jaein  Vipin Narang an MIT professor of international relations noted that the language in Tuesdays agreement bears striking similarities to a USNorth Korea declaration from 1993 Remember when they remade the movie Karate Kid 25 years later Thats what this is Narang wrote on Twitter  Oba said the outcome was however largely expected given the complexity of these issues and the seriousness of North Koreas interest in maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent He added that he would be keenly interested in whether followup talks led by Pompeo will lead to sustainable longerterm diplomatic ties between the two nations  Advertisement  Pompeo said on Monday that the United States had been fooled before by Pyongyang  Many presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didnt promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on their promises he said  The V matters Pompeo continued referring to verification We are going to ensure that we set up a system sufficiently robust that were able to verify these outcomes  Asked at Tuesdays press conference about the V word Trump insisted that North Koreas denuclearization efforts will be verified  When

Korea but said troop withdrawal was not part of the equation right now  Some commentators skewered the president for what they called a vague agreement  No verifiability provisions No inspection

officials and experts most speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter say other federal investigations of pandemic fraud also seem to point back to foreign stateaffiliated hackers  It would be crazy to think this group didnt target all 50 states said Roy Dotson national pandemic fraud recovery coordinator for the Secret Service who also acts as a liaison to other federal agencies probing Covid fraud  The Secret Service declined to confirm the scope of other investigations saying there are more than 1000 ongoing investigations involving transnational and domestic criminal actors defrauding public benefits programs and APT41 is a notable player  And whether the Chinese government directed APT41 to loot US taxpayer funds or simply looked the other way multiple current and former US officials say the theft itself is a troubling development that raises the stakes One senior Justice Department official called it dangerous and said it had serious national security implications  Ive never seen them target government money before said John Hultquist the head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant That would be an escalation  The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment  The horse is out of the barn  As soon as state governments began disbursing Covid unemployment funds in 2020 cybercriminals began to siphon off a significant percentage  The Labor Department Office of Inspector General has reported an improper payment rate of roughly 20 for the 8725 billion in federal pandemic unemployment funds though the true cost of the fraud is likely higher administration officials from multiple agencies say  Indepth analysis of four states showed 424 of pandemic benefits were paid improperly in the first six months the departments watchdog reported to Congress last week  A Heritage Foundation analysis of Labor Department data estimated excess unemployment benefits payments of more than 350 billion from April 2020 to May 2021  Whether its 350 400 or 500 billion at this point the horse is out of the barn said Linda Miller the former deputy executive director of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee the federal governments Covid relief fraud watchdog  Michael R Sherwin the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia speaks about charges and arrests related to a computer intrusion campaign tied to the Chinese government by a group called APT 41 at the Justice Department on Sept 16 2020 Tasos Katopodis  Pool via Getty Images file  By the time Covid relief funds appeared as a target of opportunity in 2020 APT41 which emerged more than a decade ago had already become the workhorse of cyberespionage operations that benefit the Chinese government according to cyber experts and current and former officials from multiple agencies The Secret Service said in a statement that it considers APT41 a Chinese statesponsored cyberthreat group that is highly adept at conducting espionage missions and financial crimes for personal gain  Ambassador Nathaniel Fick the head of the State Departments Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy said cyberespionage is a longtime Chinese national priority aimed at strengthening its geopolitical position  The United States is target No 1 because we are competitor No 1 Fick told  Its a really comprehensive multidecade wellconsidered wellresourced wellplanned wellexecuted strategy  American officials have blamed Chinese hackers for the Office of Personnel Management the Anthem Health and the Equifax breaches among others  The experts and officials describe the Chinese model of statesponsored hackers as a network of semiindependent groups conducting contract work in service of government espionage The Chinese government may direct a hacking group to attack a certain target APT41 also known to cybersecurity firms as Winnti Barium and Wicked Panda fits the model and is considered a particularly prolific Chinese intelligence asset known to commit financial crimes on the side  Demian Ahn a former assistant US attorney who indicted five APT41 hackers in 2019 and 2020 said the evidence showed the group had tremendous reach and resources The defendants who were accused of infiltrating governments and companies around the world while conducting ransomware attacks and mining cryptocurrency talked about having tens of thousands of machines at one time as part of their efforts to obtain information about others and also to generate criminal profits None of the five Chinese nationals indicted have been extradited and the cases remain open  APT41s intrusion methods have included hacking legitimate software and weaponizing it against innocent users including businesses and governments Another tactic involves tracking public disclosures about security flaws in legitimate software APT41 uses that information to target customers who dont immediately update their software according to a former Justice Department official familiar with the group  The primary purpose of APT41s statedirected activity the experts and officials say is believed to be collecting personally identifying information and data about American citizens institutions and businesses that can be used by China for espionage purposes  They have the patience the sophistication and the resources to carry out hacking that has a direct impact on national security said a former Justice Department official familiar with the group  Law enforcement officials and counterintelligence experts have testified to Congress that by now every adult American has had all or most of their personal data stolen by the Chinese government  Wild West  Beijing has increasingly turned its focus to breaching US critical infrastructure in recent years say current and former officials and China and cybersecurity experts with worldwide campaigns driven by APT41  Chinas targets include state governments which can have inadequate cybersecurity defenses The state governments dont allocate a lot of cyber protection money to their state IT infrastructure said William Evanina the former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence So its really an unprotected Wild West  The Covid fraud scheme that the Secret Service has publicly linked to APT41 began in mid2020 and spanned 2000 accounts associated with more than 40000 financial transactions  Where their sophistication comes in is the ability to work heavily and quickly the agencys Dotson said  The agency said it has been able to recover about half of the stolen 20 million in the APT41 case  Overall the Secret Service said that as of August it had seized more than 14 billion in fraudulently obtained Covid relief funds and helped return about 23 billion to state unemployment insurance programs  But while Evanina and other officials and experts consider APT41s breach of state systems a national security issue they arent convinced that stealing Covid funds was a goal of the Chinese government Such thefts increase the risk of criminal prosecution and make it harder for China to obscure the states role They believe that the Chinese government may have simply tolerated the hackers making a profit off their labors  Many believe the hackers are still inside state information technology systems  Mandiant which contracts with more than 75 state and local government organizations and agencies issued a report in March that the APT41 had infiltrated six  and likely more  state governments using back doors in popular software and was exfiltrating data on citizens  Hultquist said in an interview that Mandiant analysts discovered at least two occasions involving interactions with servers associated with state benefits after May 2021  Current officials would not comment about whether APT41 still had access to state government networks after being discovered last year  The Labor Department the Small Business Administration the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the White House all declined to comment and referred  to the Justice Department The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment  Once you are in these systems with intent to promulgate theft of personally identifying information Evanina said youre in forever noting that at the state and local levels many disparate systems share an interconnected domain Unless he said you tear down the systems and replace everything  State agencies across the country continue to struggle against invisible online attackers many lacking the proper funding and expertise to secure their online benefits systems  If we can come together and really have open and honest conversations about what works well and what went very wrong we would just be in a much better place to stop this said Maryland Labor Secretary Tiffany Robinson who said her states system is still bogged down by thousands of fraudulent applications and phone calls each week Because this is not over  Federal officials acknowledge they are nowhere close to fully accounting for what really happened to benefits programs in the pandemic  A lot of these criminals well never be able to indict and locate said a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of fraud investigations involving Chinabased hackers With the internet and the dark web its borderless', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

falling during an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago and rising costs for gasoline food and other goods have frustrated the public for months  In each case Bidens hands are largely tied frustrating Democrats and contributing to the presidents political malaise  He has signed executive action and a bipartisan bill aiming to curb gun violence He has taken some unilateral action to lower gas prices such as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve And he has called on the Senate to alter the filibuster if needed to codify Roe v Wade  None of those steps were expected to

down 15 percentage points from a year ago  A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday found 88 percent of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction with just 10 percent saying its on the right track the lowest number tallied in a Monmouth poll since 2013  Democratic strategist Joel Payne said Biden needs to change course  Theres the administrative part of the job and the

then refuse to use our full power when they do We still have time to fix this and act But we need to be brave  White House press secretary Karine JeanPierre was asked multiple times at a Tuesday press briefing about complaints from Democratic lawmakers activists and pundits that Biden has shown a lack of urgency and fire on certain issues  I cant speak for them I can only speak to what were trying to do JeanPierre said  This is a president that has been working tirelessly day in and day out since hes walked into this administration fighting for the American public she continued That is what matters to him That is what is important is delivering every way that he can to make sure that we get things done  JeanPierre pointed to the bipartisan gun legislation passed after a school shooting in Texas though Biden did not play a major role in those negotiations And she noted Biden announced executive action to protect access to abortion pills and directed the Justice Department to protect women who cross state lines for the procedure in the wake of Roes reversal  Who knew bragging about how little you know about the Constitution and hurting the only route to putting Roes protections back in place would be such a tempting dopamine hit for people who backed defunding the police and helped ensure congressional majorities were so narrow one Biden ally said  Doug Heye a Republican strategist said Biden is in a nowin situation  Im not sure theres a whole lot substantively that he can do Heye said adding that there are a few reasons Biden finds himself in this predicament  The base just wants somebody who can fight You dont have to have a plan to land the punch win the round or knock down the opponent you just need to be seen as fighting he said  But Heye also said expectations of Biden have been way too high  They have a small majority in the House and no real majority in the Senate so what did they expect he said  White House aides dispute the idea that Biden is not fighting to address issues like climate change abortion rights gun violence and inflation They pointed to his ambitious legislative proposals executive actions hes taken on guns climate and voting rights and his willingness to call for filibuster carveouts in the Senate something he had not done on the campaign trail  Aides said Biden shares the publics sense of frustration that the country has faced a series of setbacks something the president indicated in remarks during an Independence Day celebration at the White House  In recent days theres been reason to think that this country is moving backward that freedom is being reduced that rights we assumed were protected are no longer Biden said in remarks to military families on Monday A reminder that we remain in an ongoing battle for the soul of America as we have for over 200 years  I know it can be exhausting and unsettling Biden continued But tonight I want you to know were going to get through all of this

Attorney General Josh Shapiro ahead by an average of 9 points Mr Shapiro has reported 44 million in spending a state record while Mr Mastriano a retired Army colonel has spent less than 3 million Equally telling the Republican candidate has received no obvious support from his national party  Republicans pulled the plug from Mastrianos campaign a long time ago says Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report  Polls tell a different story in the states hugely consequential Senate race where Republican candidate and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz has been closing the gap with Democratic Lt Gov John Fetterman in the final weeks Several recent surveys now have Dr Oz within the margin of error and it was reported Tuesday that Republicans are pouring in an additional 6 million to try to get their candidate across the finish line Still Mr Fetterman remains the Democrats best chance to pick up a Senate seat in a cycle that is looking better and better for Republicans  But thats all assuming the polls are accurate  and if the past few elections are any indication they may not be One of the biggest challenges today many pollsters admit is capturing enough Trump supporters many of whom wont respond to the news organizations or universities that conduct most nonpartisan surveys In 2016 polls famously underestimated Mr Trumps levels of support in key states leading reporters strategists and much of the public to expect a Hillary Clinton victory Then in 2020  despite concerted efforts by pollsters to correct the problem  it essentially happened again with many polls

joint rally with Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman in Philadelphia Oct 15 2022 Most polls have shown Mr Shapiro holding a sizable lead heading into the final days of the campaign  Thats where traditional journalism can still play a key role Political reporters can often sense momentum building by paying attention to the energy and size of crowds talking to voters and interacting with

Mastriano seems to not be holding any events for anyone except for those who are following him and doesnt talk to the media I dont know if were missing his support because of that  On a recent trip to Pennsylvania Democratic staffers for races up and down the ballot were generally responsive to queries about campaign events Mr Fettermans press team was quick to send details about a rally in Bucks County that was also listed on multiple websites The candidate didnt take any questions from journalists there but at least the campaign allowed us to talk to voters A staffer shuttled reporters to

in the 8th District responded to calls Facebook messages or emails I found the time and location for Mr Mastrianos Allentown event in a post in a Pennsylvania voter Facebook group  Michael and Mark told me the restrictions were for Mr Mastrianos safety I dont know you and you dont know me said Mark  But being so tightly cordoned off meant I couldnt report on voters questions to Mr Mastriano or what he was promising them hed do in office And I certainly couldnt ask him any questions about his policy proposals such as banning abortion with no exceptions and overhauling the states voter registration process  Typically at rallies I try to gauge the enthusiasm of supporters If multiple attendees tell me its their first time at a political event or supporting a certain party thats often suggestive of a coming surge  Yet even when I can talk to voters these days often they dont want to talk to me Particularly since Mr Trump began encouraging his audiences to boo the reporters in attendance journalists have faced a drumbeat of hostility from everyday Americans  As I stood with the other reporters in the parking lot waiting to be let in to Mr Mastrianos event supporters yelled

Mastrianos support is Donald Trumps base says Terry Madonna a senior fellow at Millersville University and a longtime Pennsylvania polling expert But heres the thing In Pennsylvania if youre a Republican you cant just win with rural and smalltown voters You need to get suburban support  As Mr Madonna explains former President Trump lost Pennsylvania in 2020 despite maintaining his support among the rural smalltown voters hed won over four years earlier because Mr Biden was able to run up his margins in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs  In order to win statewide in Pennsylvania a state that still has more registered Democrats than Republicans GOP candidates have to reach beyond the partys base agrees Mr Yost  To that end Mr Mastrianos strategy of stiffarming the media may be hampering his ability to reach the suburban voters he needs to win over  Mastriano has problems because he is going to get beat significantly among those independent voters How do you get past your base if youre not talking to those people says Mr Yost If you dont engage with the media Im not sure you can build the momentum  Still Mr Mastrianos Allentown event didnt exactly feel like a campaign

the US Supreme Court will begin hearing two cases  one involving Harvard University and the other the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  challenging the constitutionality of raceconscious admissions policies  In the Harvard case the court will consider whether the school discriminated against Asian American students in the admissions process With UNC the court will consider whether the school is using raceconscious admissions in a limited enough manner  Race in admissions has been the subject of plenty of lawsuits  including at the Supreme Court level And if the court decides to reverse more than 40 years of legal precedent it could impact the way race is used in higher education beyond just admissions  The last time the court ruled on affirmative action was in 2016 when it said colleges can consider race in admissions But the makeup of the court looks very different today than it did back then  I cant think of that many people who are expecting raceconscious admissions policies to be upheld says Dominique Baker a professor of education policy at Southern Methodist University So the question is how far do they cut it off  The conservative activist group Students for Fair Admissions SFFA is behind both the Harvard and the UNC cases The suits claim that Harvard and UNCs admissions practices use race in a discriminatory way  While very similar the cases represent two very different admissions environments UNC is a state school that highly favors instate students its only allowed to admit 18 of firstyear students from out of state while Harvard is a highly selective private school that admits fewer than 5 of applicants thats just under 2000 students this fall  Affirmative action in admissions has been considered and reconsidered many times  Before that 2016 ruling in which the Supreme Court determined that the University of Texas use of race in admissions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause the court had already ruled several times on affirmative action  In 1978 the court ruled on a case involving a white man who was denied admission to medical school at the University of California Davis In that decision the court found race could be used as a factor in the admissions process but racial quotas were not allowed  Annelise Capossela for   Affirmative action hasnt always prevailed though In 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan law schools affirmative action policies but ruled that the schools undergraduate admissions officers couldnt use racial bonuses like extra points for Black Hispanic or Native American applicants on an admissions rating scale  Just a few years later in 2006 voters in Michigan approved an amendment to the state constitution that banned affirmative action programs in higher education  Michigan is one of eight states with such bans including California which banned the use of race in admissions in 1996 That state then attempted to reverse the ban through a ballot initiative in 2020 Voters chose to keep the ban in place  There are other ways to diversify student bodies  but they arent always as effective  Using race in admissions isnt the only way states and colleges have tried to diversify their incoming classes  After California banned raceconscious admissions in 1996 the proportions of Black and Latino students at the University of California Los Angeles fell drastically By 2006 a decade later only 96 Black students enrolled in a freshman class of nearly 5000 They became known as the Infamous 96  UCLA responded to those numbers by recrafting its admissions policies to take a more holistic approach considering several factors including whether students were the first in their family to go to college what high school they went to and their familys income  Annelise Capossela for   Other ideas include admitting a percentage of the states high school students like the University of Texas at Austin which automatically admits Texas students in the top 6 of their high school graduating class Lotteries have also been proposed where eligible students with high qualifications are randomly selected for acceptance  But so far researchers say none of the alternatives have been as effective as raceconscious admissions  Nothing is as good at helping to enroll a more racially equitable class than using race Nothing comes close to it says Baker at Southern Methodist University There are other tools Other ideas But if race is not taken into consideration those different types of techniques and tools do not replicate what raceconscious admissions policies do  Nothing is as good at helping to enroll a more racially equitable class than using race Nothing comes close to it  In two amicus briefs filed ahead of the HarvardUNC arguments at the Supreme Court the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley both admitted their efforts to meet their diversity goals without using race were falling short  But not every school says it is struggling to achieve diversity without raceconscious admissions The attorney general of Oklahoma filed a brief on behalf of several states in support of SFFA saying The University of Oklahoma for example remains just as diverse today if not more so than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012  Liliana Garces an education law professor at UT Austin says the debate over race in admissions is a reflection of the debate over race in America  Do we end and tackle racial discrimination by acknowledging the ways that it plays a role in our society and address those ways in higher education Garces asks Or do we just end racial discrimination by prohibiting institutions from considering race altogether Thats the misconception and the incorrect presumption that would only exacerbate those inequities  Garces joined more than 1200 social scientists in writing an amicus brief supporting Harvards admissions practices Preventing institutions from considering race she says it actually makes the situation worse  Other raceconscious efforts in education could also be at stake  There are nearly 4000 colleges and universities in the US and only a small portion  slightly more than 200  have highly selective admissions where fewer than 50 of applicants get in Thats just over 200 schools where a raceconscious admissions process could make a significant difference in who gets in  And yet despite how few students these policies would actually impact it matters a lot what the Harvards of the world do Tiffany Jones told  in 2019 when she was director of higher education policy at the Education Trust  We have to think beyond just the whogetsin and whogetstoenroll piece Dominique Baker explains This affects things like if there are any additional groups community events if there are additional scholarships in any sort of raceconscious policies that they could be on the chopping block based on these decisions  Baker wonders if a program designed to increase the number of black doctors  with support to complete the premed curriculum and get into medical school  could be called into question  Mitchell Chang who studies diversity in education at UCLA says thats what has happened in states that have banned raceconscious admissions by ballot measure Michigan California and Washington all moved to modify what were once more targeted raceconscious scholarships raceconscious programming raceconscious recruitment he says So it may have a much broader sweep in fact than just with admissions  I am deeply worried about the end of the use of race in any educational setting says OiYan Poon a visiting education professor at the University of Maryland College Park  She points to early court fillings from SFFA arguing any use of race or ethnicity in the educational setting is unconstitutional  not just in admissions  Will that mean the closure of Asian American cultural centers Poon wonders Will that mean the end of Native American studies on college campuses Will that mean the end of historically Black colleges and universities and the designations of minorityserving institutions  On Monday when oral arguments begin at the Supreme Court Poon will be listening from the court steps with her 7yearold daughter Shell be most attuned to the justices questions  to better understand the potential implications on colleges',

Hillary Clinton of New York was out campaigning again last week but this time it was not for the presidency of the United States  It was for an amendment proposed to the California state constitution that would create a right to abortion  Clinton moderated a forum at a Planned Parenthood facility in San Francisco last Thursday to promote this proposed amendment  Back in June the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization which overturned Roe v Wade and returned the issue of abortion to the states The California state legislature then voted by greaterthantwothirds majorities in both of its houses to place a constitutional amendment on the states November ballot  Proposition 1 as it is called states the following The state shall not deny or interfere with an individuals reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives This section is intended to further the constitutional right to privacy guaranteed by Section 1 and the constitutional right to not be denied equal protection guaranteed by Section 7 Nothing herein narrows or limits the right to privacy or equal protection  Nor does anything in the language of this proposed constitutional amendment limit abortion itself It does not include for example an age limit on when an unborn child can be terminated It states instead as noted that the state shall not deny or interfere with an individuals reproductive freedom  which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion  So if a woman is nine months pregnant and begins to go into labor does this proposed constitutional amendment guarantee her a right to abort that abouttobeborn baby Would a future state law that prohibited abortion after eight months of pregnancy violate this proposed amendment because it would deny or interfere with the alleged fundamental right to choose to have an abortion  Catholic Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco who has spoken out against this amendment has correctly explained that it would create a state constitutional right to unrestricted abortion  Voters this November will be asked whether they support the right to abortion for all nine months without any restrictions or limitations Cordileone said in a video message he posted on his archdiocesan website  Sadly California already has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the nation with abortion allowed without any limits within the first six months of pregnancy said the archbishop After six months abortion is allowed for reasons associated with the life or health of the mother including mental health  What Prop 1 proposes explained the archbishop is to go beyond Roe v Wade and beyond existing California law and allow abortion at any point in a pregnancy for any reason whatsoever  This is what Clinton traveled to the archbishops city to promote  The San Francisco Chronicle published a story that carried this headline Abortion measure brings Clinton to SF  Clinton moderated an hourlong panel discussion at the San Francisco Planned Parenthood office the Chronicle reported  You have to understand that these are highly motivated relentless advocates for their point of view as to how all the rest of us in this country should conduct our lives Clinton said referring to conservatives as the forces of darkness the Chronicle reported  Speaking to a room of about 100 hotpinkclad supporters legislators and members of the media reported the San Jose Mercury News Clinton told cautionary tales of repressive reproductive laws she witnessed in other countries during her time as US secretary of state  How many women have to die or be terribly mistreated in order to change these laws that are so Draconian Clinton said  I see Prop 1 as a critically important piece of the larger struggle that we are engaged in Clinton said according to the San Francisco Examiner And thats why California has to be constantly standing up for our foundational values and freedoms and rights  The Chronicle reported Clinton said the fight for Prop 1 was part of an effort to counter a much broader agenda to turn the clock back on the values the rights and freedoms that this country has been struggling to achieve in concert with our founding values  Here is Clintons ultimate claim This alleged right to take the life of an unborn child is in concert with our founding values  Yet those values were expressed in plain English in the Declaration of Independence It states We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness  Our Creator gave us all a right to life not a right to take innocent lives Proposition 1 which Clinton traveled to California to support would do exactly that  take innocent lives  Terence P Jeffrey is the editorinchief of ', 'text_b': None, 'label': 4},\n",

its most vital services running To commemorate the occasion  not unlike violins on the Titanic  longtime internet culture reporters Katie Notopoulos and Ryan Broderick hosted a massive Twitter space to discuss the demise of the service  At publish time Twitter had yet to splutter to a stop and its not a given that it will shut down Still the changes made by new owner Elon Musk  both structural like firing thousands of employees and cultural like breaking the verification system reinstating banned users and reinstating former President Donald Trump  have contributed to a feeling that something has fundamentally changed  At one point in the discussion a speaker confessed that he was ashamed to feel as angry as he did toward Musk for decimating Twitter The implication was that the cursed bird site as its so often called was just a place for shitposting and internet drama  not a place youre supposed to feel devastated about  Then again human nature just doesnt work that way Yes people loved to hate Twitter and hated loving it but the love was real nonetheless Telling ourselves its dumb to feel bad about Twitter belies the human impulse to build bonds and connection  which Twitter users spent years doing Were a species that forms unhealthy levels of emotional attachments to robots Did we really think we werent gonna feel absolutely wrecked about the apparent abrupt destruction of a social media platform that has been a digital home to millions of people for more than a decade  We have a hard time grappling with internet spaces as being real We think of them as less important or significant than real life But the truth is that for many people the connections we make online are just as significant to us as the ones we make offline A 2017 study found that online friendships can enhance feelings of companionship while a 2015 study of digital emotions albeit one conducted by Twitters marketing team found that reading tweeting and interacting with your Twitter feed can dramatically increase your emotional engagement And that was well before the pandemic relegated many of our most precious relationships to screentime and virtual messaging making Twitter matter more to more people than it had in a while  Even solely in terms of its content the loss of Twitter as an archive feels overwhelming to contemplate Jack Dorsey cofounded the site in 2006 so thats 16 years of 200 million users churning out tweets hashtags gifs memes videos art stories DMs group chats threads debates subtweets quotetweets and all the other content that the Library of Congress briefly deemed worthy of preserving That doesnt even touch the intangible stuff  the myriad human connections made the professional networks cultivated the innumerable moments of collectively experienced joy and humor and tragedy of life narrated in real time for years as it happened to each of us  Because internet culture is steeped in irony however the most extremely online of us have become rigorously conditioned to couch our sincere feelings about internet community in sarcasm and condescension After all as Broderick noted in his Twitter postmortem the online spaces we spend time on matter to us but are also full of dumb bull shit Perhaps he argued the appropriate expression of grief is a paradoxical one This era of Twitter is over and its ok to be sad about that but its also ok to feel silly that you feel sad about that  Feeling silly that you feel anything at all tends to be the default especially on the internet in the era of cringe culture to be overly sincere about something is to court derision and ridicule sincere emotionality must be glanced at sidelong especially if its about anything occurring online That might mean for example coupling your Twitter feelings with a disclaimer about how you were high or observing that Twitter wasnt just a hell site it was a hell home  This is all understandable after all it comes inflected with more than a little gallows humor But the sarcasm can also result in a sense of disenfranchised grief  a psychological term for when youve suffered a real loss that society doesnt recognize as a real loss The stages of real grief and mourning remain but without the confidence that you should be feeling sad to begin with  And yet if any internet space deserves our sincere respect its Twitter which has functioned more like a real public square than any other social media platform This is the platform that gave birth to the hashtag with all its infinite and often surprising uses It has aided the rise of countless social movements from the ArabSpring resistance to BlackLivesMatter to MeToo Not all of them have been good  see Gamergate Pizzagate QAnon et al  but they have all unequivocally mattered Twitter with its intermingling of celebrities verified professionals politicians journalists trolls bots normies alts extremists and everything in between was where the hoi polloi broke bread with the blue checks It gave us Kpop stans trolling racists with their own hashtags Its transparency and networking ability lent Twitters Black community a profound public presence a cultural prominence that not even the muchmissed Vine another gift we owe to Twitter could bestow It gave us covfefe and dog rates and horse ebooks and Nicki Minajs cousins friends testicles and dril  Theres nothing like Twitter nor will there ever be again  Thats also why its difficult to know what to replace it with if thats even possible Many of us whove been on the internet for a couple of decades have witnessed the implosions of multiple sites that at one point seemed like they were always going to be around AOL Myspace LiveJournal Vine Flickr everything Yahoo ever touched the list goes on  Nothing on the internet is permanent though not even the websites that feel closest to stodgy old edifices Building on this assumption of impermanence community experts including academics who study community migrations across internet platforms argue that the best way to ensure stability is to own your own servers and make multiple backups and to accept that your internet environment is a fragile habitat and not just a bunch of websites When one part of your habitat gets destroyed you have to rely on the whole ecosystem to recover and it can take a while But even as an experienced internet Old Im stymied by the thought of what would make an effective Twitter replacement Twitters public square holds less and less appeal in an era where harassment has grown but moderation hasnt always grown alongside it and so users have also increasingly retreated to semiprivate spaces like Discord and Telegram private group chats and WeChat  These siloed spaces make it harder to find friends across platforms and interests without Twitters transparency and searchability it will be harder to stumble across people who share a crosssection of your passions or to dive deep into your highly specific interests For example to forcibly befriend everyone who also loves James McCardles legtwitch during the Democracy in America monologue from Angels in America leading you to create a vociferous groupchat of likeminded leglikers not that I speak from experience  Not everyone desires sustained and intimate interaction with strangers but even among friends replacing Twitter wont be easy The worst thing about Musks gutting of Twitter is that if it really collapses whole communities will be uprooted and displaced Subcultures like fandoms kink communities sex workers and educators and queer and trans spaces rely heavily on the freedom of pseudonymity on Twitter But that also makes it harder to reunite with all your pseudonymous friends across platforms considering the difficulty of trying to converge on a single agreedupon substitute platform For groups that gather across language barriers the loss of Twitters easy translate tweet button means further separation from people who share your interests if not your native tongue  So yes there is a reason to mourn The reality is that this is a hard time Even if Twitter doesnt collapse it is changing and you will likely lose friends content and the ability to retrieve memories Its okay to be sad its even okay to be angry and devastated  both for what were losing and for the fact that we even had to lose it to begin with After all we the end users who are left holding this bag of weird grief and even weirder guilt about it arent the ones who ever dismissed or discounted Twitter We were right there  we still are there  doomscrolling the wretched bird app until the end  What else should we value on the internet if not the spaces like Twitter that have given us so much joy and frustration and slices of humanity What else even matters in the digital landscape if not fighting for the integrity and importance of people coming together even on platforms as broken and in need of an edit button as this one  The real loss isnt that you spent too many hours of your life scrolling this hellbird app instead of touching grass  Its that the people who destroyed it wont consider it a loss at all', 'text_b': None,

Clarine Nardi Riddle former chief of staff for Sen Joe Lieberman the onetime Democratic vice presidential nominee who lost his Connecticut primary in 2006 and went on to win reelection as an independent Independent voices can help with problemsolving They can bring different perspectives  and consensus perspectives Ms Riddle adds  Democratic frustration  Many Democrats including in Arizona see consensus as a euphemism for selling out They are frustrated that at a time when their party held the presidency and controlled both chambers of Congress one enigmatic senator from Arizona was able to sabotage key provisions they believed would help support working families and shore up voting rights They accuse her of protecting wealthy investors while torpedoing universal child care one group the Progressive Change Campaign Committee mocked her as leaving the Democratic Party to spend more time with her Wall Street family  Some are also furious that she  together with West Virginia Sen Joe Manchin  refused to end the filibuster which effectively allowed the GOP to hold the partys agenda hostage In a Senate divided 5050 over the past two years the filibuster meant Democrats needed the support of 10 GOP senators to advance most legislation rather than being able to use Vice President Kamala Harris tiebreaking vote to pass bills with a simple majority  Supporters counter that the main reason Senator Sinema was able to get elected as a Democrat in the first place is that she already had a track record of working across the aisle After an unsuccessful first year as a legislator in Arizonas Statehouse she changed tack as she explained in her 2009 book Unite and Conquer  Id spent all my time being a crusader for justice a patron saint for lost causes and Id missed out on the opportunity to form meaningful relationships with fellow members in the legislature lobbyists and other state actors she wrote I hadnt gotten any of my great policy ideas enacted into law and Id seen lots of stuff I didnt like become law  She went on to form broad coalitions to defeat a samesex marriage ban by engaging not only LGBTQ activists but also teachers and older unmarried couples whose domestic partners stood to lose their benefits She also got a law passed to prevent mothers from being kicked out of public areas for breastfeeding by framing it around motherhood rather than womens rights which engaged more conservative women who lobbied their representatives  The Arizona senator has always done a good job of reading the room says independent pollster Mike Noble Democrats couldnt win statewide in Arizona for the life of them until Sinema came along and said Hey this is how you win  Since then however Democrat Mark Kelly has won election to the Senate twice  once in a special election and again this fall by a relatively comfortable 5 percentage points  Mark Kelly just proved that you can run as a Democrat and win says Ms Haworth Senator Sinemas former campaign communications director You dont have to be some fake independent  Senator Kelly is also far more popular enjoying 89 favorability among Democrats  nearly triple Senator Sinemas rate and he polls 8 points higher than her among independents at 50  A growing number of independent voters  Still the independent voter trend is real Thom Reilly codirector of Arizona State Universitys Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy and coauthor of the recently released book The Independent Voter says Senator Sinema is reflecting the views of a lot of Arizonans as well as a national trend of voters leaving the twoparty system Some 42 of Americans now identify as independents giving them a doubledigit edge over Democrats and Republicans according to Gallup polling earlier this year  Sinema is responding to a large number of individuals that are increasingly frustrated with the parties Professor Reilly says  In the Senate Ms Sinema joins Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine both of whom are independents but caucus with Democrats One of the more elusive members Senator Sinema rarely attended Democratic caucus meetings even as a member of the party so its unlikely she will now But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said she would retain her committee assignments  Ms Riddle Senator Liebermans former chief of staff who is now chair of government affairs and strategic counsel practice at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP says Senator Sinemas new affiliation could help her former party bring others under their umbrella  She has the ability to help broaden the party says Ms Riddle a cofounder of No Labels an advocacy group that encourages bipartisan cooperation  In an oped for The Arizona Republic explaining her decision Senator Sinema implied her track record of bipartisan legislation shows she prioritizes problemsolving more than many of her colleagues in Washington  When politicians are more focused on denying the opposition party a victory than they are on improving Americans lives the people who lose are everyday Americans she wrote Arizonans  including many registered as Democrats or Republicans  are eager for leaders who focus on commonsense solutions rather than party doctrine  Andrew HarnikAPFile Senator Sinema speaks with GOP Sen Mitt Romney of Utah as she walks out of the Senate chamber to return to a private meeting with West Virginia Sen Joe Manchin the other Democratic holdout vote on President Joe Bidens domestic agenda at the Capitol in Washington Oct 27 2021  A small club  The Senate has seen its share of mavericks over the years most of whom were content to buck their party from within One of the most prominent was the late Sen John McCain The Arizona Republican challenged his own partys orthodoxy on everything from immigration to campaign finance reform Senator Sinema has called him a personal hero  But independents have been relatively rare in the Senate with Ms Sinema becoming just the 14th in history  In the 1950s liberal Republican Wayne Morse fell out of favor with the GOP and declared himself an independent pulling his chair into the center aisle of the Senate to make a point He later became a Democrat but retained an independent streak he was one of only two senators to oppose the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which gave the president authority for escalating US military involvement in Vietnam  Half a century later Jim Jeffords of Vermont upended the chamber when  frustrated with President George W Bush who took office in 2001 after a disputed election that ended with Supreme Court intervention  he left the GOP to become an independent and caucus with Democrats His move gave Democrats the majority overnight and all the newly appointed Republican committee chairs had to step down  It was like an earthquake recalls former Senate historian Donald Ritchie People were very upset  But Democrats would have their own challenges a few years later when Senator Lieberman got reelected as an independent Though he caucused with Democrats he now represented a broader cross section of voters and leveraged his status to extract concessions  Ross Baker a Rutgers political scientist who spent time as a scholarinresidence in Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reids office said the Connecticut senator was always a pain in the neck for Democratic leadership  Placating Joe Lieberman to pick up a vote was a very painful thing for Reid to have to do he says recalling in particular protracted negotiations over the Affordable Care Act with the senator from Connecticut home to large health insurance companies  Senator Sinemas legacy as an independent will be up to her says Professor Baker  She can basically support Democratic positions on most major issues and on occasion march to her own drummer he says But he adds if she becomes kind of defiant about her independent status thats different  Get stories that  empower and uplift daily By signing

military refocuses from the war on terror to potential combat with the big fourChina Russia North Korea and Iran  As Israel has become a fullfledged military partner the US intelligence community is also putting more emphasis on its Hebrew language program to spy on its numberone Mideast ally  For the Pentagon Israel is the most prized military and intelligence partner in the Middle East with its vast combat experience and advanced technologies With the end of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq and with the brokering of the Abraham Accords by the Trump administration Washington sees an opportunity to incorporate Israel into a new regional alliance The Accords established diplomatic relations between Israel and several of its Arab neighbors  Israel is coming out of the closet allowed now to openly cooperate with the US military while at the same time being denied access to another closet says a senior intelligence official referring to the world of American intelligence The official who requested anonymity to discuss military planning says that for some things such as targeting exchanges are part of the new military alliance But where USIsraeli interests might diverge such as counterintelligence against Israeli spying or uncovering secrets about Israels own nuclear arsenal the United States has redoubled its collection efforts  Read more Joe Biden caught admitting Iran nuclear deal is dead in video Joe Biden caught admitting Iran nuclear deal is dead in video  President Biden signed a major change of the biennial Unified Command Plan last year codifying the change in Israels position in US military planning The Unified Command Plan is the highest level document that determines every commands area of operations UCP 2021 shifted Israel to US Central Command CENTCOM the command responsible for the Middle East from its previous assignment as part of European Command EUCOM European Command oversaw the military dimensions of the special relationship working with the country to defend it in very specific circumstances against its neighbors  According to the Pentagon the previous system of special channels outside the Middle East allowed CENTCOM to build a coalition among Arab allies without having the complication of a relationship with Israela sworn enemy to many of those countries But it segregated Israel from formally partnering with CENTCOM and contingency planning against a common enemy  CENTCOM will now work to implement the US Government commitment to a holistic approach to regional security and cooperation with our partners the Tampabased command said after it was given responsibility over Israel The easing of tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors subsequent to the Abraham Accords has provided a strategic opportunity for the United States to align key partners against shared threats in the Middle East Israel is a leading strategic partner for the United States and this will open up additional opportunities for cooperation with our US Central Command partners while maintaining strong cooperation between Israel and our European allies the Pentagon announced  Government sources tell  that behind the seeming bureaucratic adjustment the new assignment is the most profound change for the US military since Israels founding The hope some might say pipedream is to pave the way for a regional military alliance similar to NATO in Europe not only to prepare for war with Iran but also thwart Russian and Chinese encroachment in the region  Intelligence on Israel  New status and cooperation notwithstanding Israel is consistently at the top of US intelligence priorities  Israel is a world military leader and an expert in many forms of modern warfareair and missile defense directed energy weapons such as lasers and unmanned systemsthat the Pentagon perceives are crucial in any future battle Israel possesses nuclear weapons and has unilateral policies and plans against its adversaries that are of interest to the top decisionmakers in Washington In dealing with Israel Washington has followed two sometimes dueling tracks of cooperation and rivalry  The CIA is responsible for relations with Israels intelligence agenciesand with collecting information on the Israeli leadership The US armed forces are responsible for military intelligence on everything from Israels technology to its capabilities and plans Within the military the NSA eavesdrops on Israeli communicationswhile also cooperating with its Israeli counterparts who in term spy on its Arab neighbors and Iran  About 1000 qualified Hebrew linguists in the US government work on questions related to Israel Most of these Hebrew linguists have overt functionsin diplomacy as defense attaches and liaisons But about onethird work in intelligence collection and analysis specifically related to spying on Israel The NSAresponsible for signals intelligencecurrently has some 250 Hebrew linguists who translate secure Israel government dispatches military communications and highly targeted cell phone traffic A significant number also monitor and analyze Israeli press social media and other open source communications in Hebrew Hundreds more Hebrew linguists work under contract both at the NSA and other intelligence agencies assisting government employees and members of the armed services  By 2025 according to intelligence sources the number of qualified military Hebrew linguists is programmed to double That number is increasing according to intelligence documents and government sources partly to service the increased cooperation  Hebrew language intelligence training is centered at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey California where prospective linguists also learn Jewish and Israeli history cultural studies and historical and modern antisemitism analysis From there the eavesdroppers go to Fort Gordon in Augusta Georgia where the NSA operates its massive Middle East eavesdropping and analysis center in support of the military The most sensitive political intelligence is handled at Ft Meade in Maryland Most Hebrew linguists in the intelligence field are assigned to these two bases as well as to ship and airbased collection platforms  Read more China Targets Israeli Technology in Bid for Global Dominance As US Frets China Targets Israeli Technology in Bid for Global Dominance As US Frets  Israel is a difficult country to spy on not only because of its technical expertise and its routine focus on operational security against its neighbors and other adversaries That means that it practices good communications and cybersecurity discipline and uses sophisticated cryptography in coding its messages Much of the US intelligence collection effort consequently is focused on microtargeting of individuals ie their cell phones computers and other devices where intelligence can be gleaned from more easily exploitable devices  The more that Israel is a credible military opponent of Iran the very reason for this shakeup the more that they are also suspect for the very capabilities that we are helping to create and improve says the senior intelligence official who has worked on the relationship This is a case of keep your enemies close and your friends closer the official says  Israel has consistently denied spying on the United States since relations were soured by the 1985 arrest of Jonathan Pollard who pleaded guilty of selling military secrets to Israel but allegations of different forms of espionage have continued over the years   reached out to the Israeli Defense Forces for comment but had not received a response at time of publication  Making friends  Only the amicable aspect of the USIsraeli relationship was on show when chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley hosted his counterpart incoming head of the Israeli General Staff Maj Gen Herzi Halevi at the Pentagon on December 5  According to the Defense Department readout the two discussed coordination to defend against threats posed by Iran among other issues The meeting between the two military heads wound up a whirlwind of joint military activities in the past year since President Biden approved Israels new status including similar exchanges by highlevel commanders joint exercises and bilateral meetings regarding everything from cyber security to missile defense  The December meeting followed a Washington visit by Lt Gen Aviv Kohavi current chief Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces where he met with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan According to the White House readout of that meeting their discussions emphasized their shared determination to address security challenges impacting the Middle East including the threats posed by Iran and its proxies  American CENTCOM commander Gen Michael Erik Kurilla then went to Israel to meet with Kohavi making his fourth visit in just seven months since he had become commander of CENTCOM Calling the military alliance ironclad Kurilla said that the Middle East is at the center of Americas strategic competition with Russia and China The true focus for CENTCOM though is Iran  Speaking of Kurillas visit Kohavi said that the two countries were developing joint military capabilities at an accelerated rate against Tehran According to the Times of Israel the militarytomilitary exchange included discussion of the joint use of force against Tehran  Our mutual commitment is demonstrated on a weekly basis We are operating together on all fronts to gather intelligence neutralize threats and prepare for various scenarios in either one or multiple arenas Kohavi was quoted as saying  As part of Kurillas visit he went to Nevatim airbase which hosts Israels new wing of Americanmade F35i fighter jets the most advanced in the US arsenal which the United States has sold to Israel Israel maintains a remarkably impressive airpower capability Kurilla said at Nevatim  Days after Kurillas visit US Air Force and Israeli fighter jets took to the skies above the eastern Mediterranean Sea to practice combined operations The Air Force package included KC10 Extender aerial refuelers planes that can extend the range of fighters for longrange strikes In March 2020 the State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Israel of up to eight KC46 aerial refueling aircraft to give the country its own longrange strike capability  In addition to numerous visits and exchanges by other CENTCOM commanders additional components of the US military have also accelerated visits and training The Army has increased air defense cooperation This includes an updated Juniper Cobra exercise and a new Combined Air Defense Working Group The Missouri National Guard has a training partnership with Israel The US and Israeli navies have increased their level of joint training and port visits In January the Pentagons Missile Defense Agency and its Israeli counterpart also conducted a flight test of the jointly developed Arrow 3 missile interceptor The military exercise Cyber Dome VIi was also held between the two nations cyber commands earlier this month  The Ukraine war in particular has focused US military attention on missile defense and counterdrone operations both of which are areas of expertise for the Israel military This summer for example the US and Israeli navies conducted the bilateral exercise called Digital Shield to test out future unmanned swarming and artificial intelligence warfare  Kurilla formerly commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps has been a fan of increasing the use of artificial intelligence in warfare We can take large pieces of terrain and rapidly identify hundreds of targets prioritize them based on a high priority target list that determines which ones we should strike with the resources that we have Kurilla said in May  That happens in seconds versus what would take hours normally or sometimes even days to be able to develop these targets And its doing it in realtime at the edge in our command posts and not being tied just back into a garrison computing environment  As part of its new status Israel has also participated in a number of multinational exercises including the Americanled Rim of the Pacific 22 exercise in Asia and Global Sentinel 22 a war game focused on space warfare Neither of those two exercises included any other Mideast nations though military sources say that such matchups will soon include both Israel and Arab states as participants  Bahrain one of the Arab countries to normalize relations with Israel has allowed Israeli government and military delegations to visit and work with the US Navy Fifth Fleet which is based there Last December an Israeli government national security delegation arrived in Bahrain to meet at Fifth Fleet headquarters an unprecedented visit In March Fifth Fleet commander Vice Adm Brad Cooper also hosted Lt Gen Kohavi at its headquarters  Israel as partner  Israel has always been a perplexing country for the US military in war plans it was a country to be defended in the case of the big if but never acknowledged as such As a result Israel was treated as special different and secret assigned to a command outside the Middle East After the IsraelArab war in 1973 the oil embargo that followed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian revolution the idea of creating a special command for the region solidified into a Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force To help defend US interests in the region the new Floridaheadquartered CENTCOM was set up with President Ronald Reagans approval in December 1982 but because of the complexities of the region EUCOM retained responsibility for the socalled confrontation states of Israel Syria and Lebanon as well as Morocco Algeria Tunisia and Libya  That arrangement remained in place until 911 and the start of the war on terror when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Israel Syria and Lebanon be added to the CENTCOM portfolio Everyone except the Air Force rejected the idea arguing that change might influence the peace process and that EUCOM and Israel had built a strong working relationship Overruling the generals and admirals Rumsfeld came up with an endrun getting President George W Bush to agree to move Syria and Lebanon to CENTCOM Only Israel would stay a part of the European command  With the end of the war on terror at least formally the Joint Chiefs again took on the question of Israel An African Command had been created and was now responsible for North Africa leaving Israel as the sole anomaly What is more CENTCOM needed relevance in the postterrorism world of military planning The discussions were already underway when President Biden took office Military sources agree that the Abraham Accords facilitated the change even if the main objective behind the renewed military alliance was focused on Iran  Israel brings some very unique capabilities in terms of their military component that they believe they can share with their Arab partners in the region General Kurilla said in May in his Senate nomination hearing to become the next CENTCOM commander Kurilla sees a closer military coalition between Israel and the Arab states over Iran If he and other Pentagon leaders are successful in this goal a regionwide military alliance will be brought to the Middle East  Finally the US military is openly reaping the benefits of Israels military prowess and technology says a Pentagon planner who has been involved in the Israel changes Openly  thats the key word The United States already deploys logistical support units radar and an air defense unit in Israel says the planner granted anonymity to discuss classified matters Next up is more visits and joint training and eventually military bases and then a NATOlike military alliance All in the name of Iran and Russia and the transition to major war But will Israels neighbors go along Will all of the region unify to prepare for war with Iran Thats the major question', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

       " {'guid': 10868, 'text_a': 'Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  That Donald Trump files frivolous lawsuits aimed at intimidating his critics and rallying his supporters is not something thats in any legitimate dispute Over and over his lawsuits have failed in court  particularly when the target has been election results or media companies Wp Get the full experience Choose your plan ArrowRight Last month a federal judge roundly rejected another of the former presidents lawsuits  this one against Hillary Clinton  labeling it a twohundredpage political manifesto rather than a serious claim The judge also cited the audacity of Plaintiffs legal theories and the manner in which they clearly contravene binding case law  So how does Trump respond to that Naturally by filing another audacious transparently political lawsuit that also seeks to disregard binding case law  Trumps latest lawsuit targets CNN which he wants to pay him 475 million for invoking Adolf Hitler in its coverage of him And perhaps even more than its predecessors this one should be understood for exactly what it is a personal grievance in search of an actual legal strategy In 2020 Trumps campaign also sued The  over opinion columns alleging that the campaign was connected to Russian electoral interference that case is pending A similar suit against the New York Times was dismissed last year  Advertisement  The lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and non sequiturs The argument effectively is that CNN invoking Hitler while talking about Trump  including calling his quest to overturn the 2020 election based on voterfraud falsehoods the big lie  automatically defames him  But to prove that claim the lawsuit leans heavily on random Twitter users who responded to CNNs work by making a much more direct comparison between Trump and Hitler than the network itself had  Trumps legal team contends that CNN must have known citing the big lie would infringe on Trumps rights because the networks new head Chris Licht reportedly said he didnt like the phrase But the report they cite from Fox News merely states Licht didnt like the phrase because it was imprecise and reflected language used by Democrats rather than because he worried about legal action The lawsuit also claims CNN anchors were explicitly instructed by Licht not to use the phrase but the Fox report says the opposite  that Licht did not issue a mandate or formal guidance to stop using the term  Advertisement  At another point when the lawsuit alleges CNN has been spreading propaganda it cites as proof that an NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll from 2019 found that 99 percent of CNN viewers believed that the Plaintiff lied about the Russia investigation But the poll didnt ask about Trump lying rather it asked about whether he had not been honest and truthful about it And the Mueller Report found that Trump had indeed not been honest and truthful  The lawsuit also cites CNN merely reporting on Democrats who compared Trump to Hitler saying such coverage is nothing more than selfserving pronouncements by political opponents of the Plaintiff and their news proxy and political participant CNN If reporting on such claims is defamation Fox News might want to watch out  But even beyond the odd and sometimes false presentation of the details the lawsuit advances a remarkably thin and novel legal theory that just begs a judge to dispatch it  Advertisement  First it argues that CNNs reporting meets the legal standard of actual malice set forth in the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v Sullivan That precedent requires plaintiffs to prove the statements made by the media were not only false and defamatory but that they were made either with the knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth  But just as quickly it argues that that standard shouldnt apply  In a footnote it says that that standard does not  and should not  apply where the media defendant is not publishing statements to foster debate critical thinking or the unfettered interchange of ideas but rather seeks to participate in the political arena by offering propaganda  The argument is apparently that CNN is not acting as a media organization so it should not benefit from the higher standard for legal damages in New York Times v Sullivan That would be a startling conclusion for a judge to make no matter what you think about CNN  Advertisement  With that out of the way Trumps lawyers proceed to argue that any comparison between a public official or political candidate and Hitler is defamation per se  that is that such comparisons are so damaging that they must be considered defamatory on their face  Being likened to Hitler is historically defamation per se as such a comparison tends to subject the target  and has subjected the Plaintiff  to hatred contempt distrust ridicule and even fear the comparison has had an adverse impact on the Plaintiffs reputation and political career it says It adds When a public official or political candidate is likened to Hitler it is defamation per se as the statement imputes a characteristic or condition incompatible with the proper exercise of that public office  Advertisement  As some noted when the lawsuit was filed this would effectively open up anyone who has ever compared a politician to Hitler to being sued Whats more that legal argument doesnt address the truthfulness of the statement What if the comparison was between an actual neoNazi and Hitler for example  The lawsuit ultimately does get around to citing actual court decisions in making its case It argues that the Hitler characterization is one that courts across jurisdictions have historically considered defamation per se  The evidence cited for this is bad  In a footnote Trumps legal team cites State v Guinn ODonnell v Philadelphia Record Co and Goodrich v Reporter Pub Co If you havent heard of these cases its because they are not federal ones They also all predate 1964s New York Times v Sullivan meaning the actual malice standard couldnt have been applied because it didnt yet exist  Advertisement  Whats more even these cases dont seem to apply to the case at hand As Akiva Cohen noted the last one dealt with a Texas newspaper which falsely stated that a local draft board had declared the plaintiff to be proNazi The second one dealt with a Philadelphia newspaper which stated that the plaintiff has broadcast his sympathy with most of Hitlers aims  such as  liquidation of Jews  In other words these cases turned on factual claims rather than just opinions or comparisons Trumps legal team though would like to argue that any likening of Trump and what Hitler did is illegal even if its obviously offered as an opinion and even if the comparison isnt as direct as it was in these cases  Oh and Trumps legal team would like the courts to ignore Supreme Court precedent to find in their favor  GiftOutline Gift

       " {'guid': 10884, 'text_a': 'WASHINGTON  As Republicans prepare to use their new House majority to probe the Biden administration and the business dealings of the presidents son Hunter Democrats are assembling a constellation of groups to respond  President Joe Biden hasnt said if hes running for reelection but the groups are designed to defend him and discredit the opposition  including launching intense opposition research efforts into Republicans leading the charge in Congress  ahead of a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in 2024  Three new war rooms have sprung up in the past two weeks to combat the House Republicans investigations each backed by multimilliondollar dark money budgets and some of the bestknown operatives in the Democratic Party Meanwhile the Democratic National Committee and major outside groups are already retooling to shift from 2022 to 2024  Its clear the White House has been preparing for the anticipated barrage of meritless investigations from House Republicans and outside groups are an essential component said Adrienne Elrod who helped run Correct the Record which defended Hillary Clinton from congressional probes before her 2016 presidential campaign was up and running  Every White House has faced congressional investigations But the surfeit of wellfunded groups shows eagerness among Democratic donors to defend Biden  or at least stop Trump  and a recognition that the fight over public opinion is at least as important as the legal one since it will lay the groundwork for the next campaign  Its important that the opposition not get the upper hand in defining a false narrative and outside groups can help mitigate that from happening Elrod noted  The White House itself has been preparing for months for the barrage of inquiries adding both legal and public relations firepower to the White House Counsels Office which is quarterbacking its effort and encouraging federal agencies to take similar moves  This summer as it looked likely that Republicans would win one or both chambers of Congress a small group of White House staffers began mapping out likely investigative angles keeping close tabs on top Republican investigators including letters of inquiry they sent to federal agencies  There are a lot of constraints on the administration when responding to oversight investigations  even ones that are completely bogus  but none of which apply to outside groups said Eric Schultz a former Obama White House spokesperson who tangled daily with Republican congressional investigators ahead of President Barack Obamas 2012 reelection bid  For instance government officials are prohibited by federal law from politicking And the White House prefers to stay above the political fray anyway So outside groups can provide political and PR support especially in the absence of a Biden campaign and can get down into the mud on especially sensitive issues like Hunter Biden  Both sides insist theyre just after the truth But the politics of the situation is undeniable and only thinly veiled  Rep Jim Jordan ROhio who is poised to use his likely chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to aggressively investigate alleged politicization of the Justice Department said last month at CPAC that the GOP majority would work to frame up the 2024 race  These are sham investigations You can take Jordans word at it said Kyle Herrig the founder and executive director of one of the new war rooms the Congressional Integrity Project which is relaunching to counter the investigations They dont have an agenda that will help Americans They have only one agenda and its a political agenda  The Congressional Integrity Project which already has focus groups underway promises to be as much about offense as defense It plans to investigate the lawmakers investigating Biden many of whom hail from the safe congressional districts and have never faced a tough election and the kind of opposition

the Congressional Integrity Project is focused on the investigations Courage for America is focused on the legislation and personalities of the entire House GOP caucus  Among other things that means making firebrand freshman lawmakers famous And it means highlighting and mobilizing opposition to GOP policies such as a proposed national abortion ban and potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare  The American people need to be introduced and educated about the extremist agenda of this new House and also who these members are said Zac Petkanas who was the Clinton campaigns rapid response director and is now running a war room supported by Courage for America Its a very dangerous new caucus and were going to be there every single day making sure people know about it  With a

traditional opposition research and communications  The third group Facts First was started by David Brock the former selfdescribed rightwing hit man who then had a political conversion and used his fundraising talent to start a series of groups that have become key parts of Democratic infrastructure Those include Media Matters and American Bridge both of which he stepped away from to start Facts First  Brock said an American Bridge donor has already pledged sixfigures to support Facts First which he said would likely have a 10 million budget over two years Cofounders include former Republican Rep David Jolly a Trump critic who has since left the party and longtime Democratic strategist Maria Cardona  Unlike the other two groups in order to maintain its independence Facts First decided not to formally approach the White House for its blessing though backchannel communications led it to believe the effort is welcome  Brock who also founded the proClinton Correct the Record said that experience taught him the new group needs to be more aggressive on social media and conduct more opinion research to understand how Americans view the controversy du jour  I do believe that absent a vigorous operation like the one were putting out I think it makes it difficult for President Biden to be reelected he said before quickly adding that its the Republicans that are really making this a political issue We are doing this in response  Of the new groups Brocks appears to be working most closely with Hunter Biden and his legal team led by entertainment lawyer Kevin Morris  Hunter Bidens relationship struggles with drugs and alcohol and business efforts to fund it all are sure to be a major focus of Republican inquiries Republicans have long argued that Biden helped his sons overseas business dealings  the claim was at the center of Trumps first impeachment  but are still searching for evidence to prove it  Brock recently traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Hunter Biden and said he came away reassured  I came out of that not nervous I came out of that thinking that well be able to show over time this is a Republican fantasy narrative driven by a lot of unreliable witnesses and spurious conspiracy theories he said To me the main story here is of an addictive person who has mental health issues of the kind that are in most families in America  I also think its the story

commentary are his own View more opinion on      Concluding its final public meeting Monday the House January 6 committee released a summary of its key findings  the conclusions of which are devastating even if they lack all the details expected in the final report  Julian Zelizer   Following 18 months of deliberations and hearings more than 1000 witnesses and countless documents the committee has produced a blistering account accusing former President Donald Trump and his allies of attempting to overturn the 2020 election  For anyone who continues to believe that the January 6 2021 insurrection was exaggerated or was a haphazard amateurish effort gone bad the final report should throw cold water on those beliefs The committees recommendations are historic  The panel made four criminal referrals against Trump including charges of insurrection to send to the US Justice Department If the United States is to survive as a nation of laws and democracy the committees chairman Rep Bennie Thompson said we can never let this happen again  The referral is largely symbolic because it doesnt obligate federal prosecutors to bring criminal charges  But the committees findings have provided a formidable body of evidence that there was an elaborate effort led by the President of the United States and his Republican allies in Congress to systematically overturn an election that he lost  The committee documented what it said was Trumps intentionality strategy and planning behind the dangerous effort to overturn votes to find new votes and ultimately to stoke an attack on the US Congress even though he knew he had lost  President Trump was informed over and over again by his senior appointees campaign experts and those who had served him for years the executive summary states that his election fraud allegations were nonsense The panel relied on the testimony of some of Trumps top advisers to build its case as well as the public record  The committee found that Trump stoked the violence with incendiary tweets and that the White House was purposely slow in responding to the insurrection at the US Capitol  Citing former President Ronald Reagan a conservative icon Rep Liz Cheney one of the panels two Republicans argued that the peaceful transfer of power was a miracle of our system and only one President  Trump  had failed to abide by this process  When the mob attacked the Capitol Cheney added Trump engaged in shameful behavior by sitting and watching the violence on television His actions Cheney said were unlawful and an utter moral failure and a clear dereliction of duty When he finally agreed to call off his supporters Rep Elaine Luria noted he did so with language that justified what the rioters had done  The findings certainly rank among the worst scandals in presidential history It is fair to say that a sitting President being part of a concerted effort to reverse his own election stands alongside the abuses of power that President Richard Nixon engaged in and the violations of law under the Reagan administration exposed during the IranContra hearings  Without question the revelations far overshadow the allegations that were at the center of President Bill Clintons impeachment  In other words the committee concluded that Trump made history by participating in an unrivaled abuse of presidential power that threatened the very foundation of our democracy elections While the term unprecedented has been grossly overused in this case the term works  But the question is what impact will the January 6 committees final report have when its released Wednesday  The committee has done its business at a moment in American history when shock and awe among the public seem impossible The historic impact of congressional investigations has always depended on the ability of elected officials to move the political needle by producing findings that prove a leader acted far outside the parameters of whats acceptable  The smoking gun tape that allowed legislators to hear Nixon obstructing an investigation were enough in 1974 for politicians in both parties to say enough  The discoveries that national security officials in the Reagan administration violated the Boland Amendment by sending money and arms to the Nicaraguan Contras caused Reagans approval ratings to plummet and put his legacy in jeopardy  The President was only saved by the fact that the committee could not directly connect the illicit operation to him and by the fact that the administration mounted an effective public relations campaign to win back public support Congressional Democrats moreover decided that they wouldnt pursue impeachment  Even Clintons scandal which was over an issue far less relevant than what faced Nixon or Reagan clearly contradicted his public statements and legal testimony about the subject after DNA evidence emerged of his affair with Monica Lewinsky  We live in a period today where it is unclear that any congressional investigation can still have an outsize impact One of the factors that makes it difficult for Congress to shift political momentum is that intense political polarization overwhelms all other concerns  Even 911 or the pandemic didnt produce a serious political realignment Polarization is almost always triumphant even when the leader of a party is found to have committed egregious abuses of power  Another related challenge stems from what social scientists call asymmetric polarization The Republican Party has moved further to the right than Democrats have to the left And much of the extremism in the GOP has been tactical where some party leaders have embraced a form of smashmouth partisanship with no guardrails as to what is permissible  In this case the odds that the relevant party will change its ways or respond are minimal It is worth remembering that Senate Republicans originally filibustered the plan to set up an independent bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 and did not cooperate with the congressional committee set up instead  The Republicans who did serve on the committee  Cheney and Rep Adam Kinzinger of Illinois  have been attacked marginalized and essentially pushed out of the party During the 2022 midterms election denialism was a central campaign theme for the GOP rather than an issue candidates ran away from  Nor does our media ecosystem lend itself to the sort of reaction that took place with Watergate While there was a time such as the 1970s when professional journalists coalesced around the facts presented by a judicious investigation those times are gone  Partisan media outlets such as Fox News ignore the weight of evidence Show hosts are more than willing to spin the news in a particular direction that satisfies political yearnings  In the coming weeks there will likely be stories that misrepresent what the committee discovered and that will promote conspiratorial claims with no basis in fact The filterless world of social media probably will offer ample opportunity to push disinformation that contradicts the harrowing stories found in the report  The opposition in the congressional investigation of IranContra put out a minority report in 1987 but today that is no longer necessary Opponents of the committee have multiple platforms and opportunities to spin a different tale that undercuts the power that the official findings will have  And some of the forces that will check the impact of the report stem from a broader national culture that seems incapable of staying focused on issues for long In our short attention span everything must be new and fresh we push the media from one issue to the other  and much of the news media happily oblige  with the lightning speed of TV commercials  The January 6 committee already has experienced this challenge as dramatic televised hearings which proved capable of shifting attention to how bad the coup attempt had been were quickly drowned out by the latest celebrity scandal or news story coming from Washington There are so many outlets for information that it is virtually impossible to keep the public eye committed to any single subject  The Watergate scandal was the story that defined much of the period between 1972 and 1974 but for many Americans January 6 has just become one other thing among many that happened in the chaos of our era  Finally Attorney General Merrick Garland now faces a politically perilous decision of whether to indict Trump especially since he is now officially one of President Joe Bidens campaign opponents in 2024 Garland has appointed a special counsel Jack Smith who is overseeing the investigations of Trump and will make recommendation s  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for  Opinions newsletter Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The question is whether this report will push Garland toward taking action to ensure accountability rather than focusing on concerns about fueling division within the electorate  Given its expected dramatic findings the January 6 report is certainly a stress test for the problematic state of our democracy It is unlikely however to change the basic dynamics  Barring successful prosecutions of key players the odds are that within a few months many Americans may tragically think of the report as ancient history rather than compelling evidence accusing a major 2024 presidential candidate of coming close to overturning results of the election system thats the best our democracy has to offer', 'text_b': None, 'label':

this into the body of the bill she said Getting this issue off the table and bringing some common sense to bear around the vaccine mandate was a very important thing to do  The Pentagon has 30 days after the passage of the NDAA to terminate the vaccine mandate Blackburn also said that once the mandate is officially rescinded Congress can focus on ensuring those troops who were discharged are made whole and have their benefits restored  COAST GUARDSMEN ON CUSP OF 20YEAR RETIREMENT MARK DEPRIVED OF BENEFITS OVER RELIGIOUS VAX OBJECTIONS  There are many that have been removed Blackburn said citing the thousands of service members who have been discharged across all military branches for refusing the vaccine And some of those had already had COVID Some of those had medical exemptions that were denied And we are continuing to work through this issue and to be certain that people are made whole will be important But right now it is getting this lifted and once we have done that we will

the COVID19 vaccine mandate due to religious objections are now being terminated just before they gain full access to promised military pension and retirement benefits  Other lawmakers are speaking up about this saying Congress needs to take additional action  These heroes deserve justice now that the mandate is no more The Biden administration must correct service records and not stand in the way of reenlisting any service member discharged simply for not taking the COVID vaccine House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif said in a statement  Make no mistake this is a win for our military But

this Administration said McCarthy who is poised to become the next speaker of the House in January if he secures enough votes  Rep Greg Steube RFla told  Digital that he is disappointed the NDAA text doesnt provide for full reinstatement of discharged service members but the incoming House majority will right that wrong  We shouldnt underscore the significance of this win for freedom and religious liberty  but the vast majority of our military personnel have already been coerced into receiving the COVID19 vaccine or involuntarily separated said Steube Im disappointed the NDAA does not include language for a full reinstatement of these individuals into the military I can assure you in the GOP majority were going to do whats right and make sure the DoD corrects military records processes

RCalif told  Digital he is dissatisfied with the House proposal to strip the military COVID19 vaccine mandate from the text of the national defense spending bill and said it must go further to stop the demoralization that US service members have endured   The repair has to be reinstating individuals who want to come back correcting their records allowing these individuals who have served honorably to be recognized that way he said  Issa said he will propose two types of legislation in the next Congress when Republicans take the majority The first will be the Religious Exemption Recognition Act which would reinstate and restore those who refused the vaccine for any number of valid reasons  Second he will establish a process to review religious accommodation cases that will be

samesex marriage  Biden referenced the television appearance in his own remarks at the signing ceremony Ten years ago I got into trouble he said He was vice president at the time and he had endorsed gay marriage before thenPresident Barack Obama  The White House did not play any footage of another Biden Meet the Press interview from 2006 Marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that he said  MORE WAYS TO LOSE THAN MAGA  In fact the White House has airbrushed the first interview out of history And he said something that really no other national elected official was saying at the time that marriage is a proposition press secretary Karine JeanPierre said of the later Meet the Press interview And its about you know who you love but if you are going  Im going to mess up his quote  but who you love but also about if youre going to be loyal to that person  And he has always been an ally JeanPierre continued In September she went a step further  And this is an issue when it comes to marriage equality that he has supported through  through his Senate days and as VP and now as president Bidens press secretary said  This isnt true Biden opposed samesex marriage when he and Obama were first elected in 2008 He opposed it when he was running against Obama for the Democratic nomination He opposed it in the earlier Meet the Press interview And he opposed it in the Senate  Technically the Defense of Marriage Act from the 1990s was still on the books but essentially dormant because of the Obergefell decision JeanPierre told reporters later in Tuesdays briefing as she explained what the Respect for Marriage Act would do This repeals DOMA and ensures federal recognition of samesex marriages  Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act as a senator from Delaware in 1996 It prevented the federal recognition of samesex marriages and allowed states to do the same for samesex marriages performed in other states  If Biden changed his mind about samesex marriage he was hardly alone When Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act a Gallup poll found only 27 supported samesex marriage In June 71 did  The Defense of Marriage Act passed the Senate by a vote of 85 to 14 The House vote for its enactment was 342 to 65 President Bill Clinton  a Democrat signed it into law Biden wasnt alone here either  But the truth matters Bidens views on samesex marriage have never been cuttingedge When majorities opposed it so did he Once support for samesex marriage became the mainstream Democratic position Biden adopted it  That is why Biden got into trouble with Obama for his gay marriage endorsement Obama and Biden were under activist pressure for being late to supporting samesex marriage By the time Biden announced his new stand most rankandfile Democrats were already on board Preempting Obama made him look bad with liberals  Obama and Biden had hesitated because of residual opposition from Hispanic and especially black voters Black Californians voted in 2008 for Obama and Biden and to define marriage as a man and a woman by passing the ballot initiative Proposition 8  The sincerity of their opposition to samesex marriage by that time could be called into question  in his 2006 Meet the Press interview Biden was invoking the Defense of Marriage Act in part to explain his opposition to a Republicanbacked federal marriage amendment  but it remained reflected in federal law until the Supreme Court handed down Obergefell v Hodges Public support for samesex marriage hit 60 in Gallup the month before the decision  The other issue is the strident tone Biden and his team have taken toward people who continue to espouse the same position on marriage he held for most of his adult life Biden said he was striking a blow against hate JeanPierre spoke of extremist conservatives who appear bent on taking away fundamental rights including marriage equality  Liberals may be shellshocked by the reversal of Roe v Wade earlier this year and frequently invoked a stray sentence on substantive due process in Justice Clarence Thomass concurring opinion that wasnt joined by any other justice and isnt supported by Justice Samuel Alitos majority opinion But there is no comparison between the nearly 50year legal and political campaign to overturn Roe which came within one vote of being reversed 30 years ago and the remaining antiObergefell activities  Thats why the Respect for Marriage Act essentially codifying Obergefell sailed through Congress and a bill ostensibly codifying Roe couldnt get majority support in a Democraticcontrolled Senate  How Biden speaks of faithbased and traditional views of marriage matters because of religious liberty concerns Opponents believed the Respect for Marriage Acts religious liberty protections were weak Others maintain they went too far  Theres a section here that speaks to the ability of nonprofit religious organizations faithbased social agencies educational institutions employees of those organizations to deny services accommodations facilities goods advantages privileges to gay couples a reporter said to JeanPierre at Tuesdays White House briefing So how is that not codifying discrimination  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE IN THE   Biden the second Catholic president may face political pressure from those who believe religious liberty exemptions are

States obstruction of Congress and conspiracy to make a false statement  The panel also referred for possible prosecution five allies of Mr Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyers Rudolph Giuliani John Eastman Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro  The committee believes there is evidence Mr Trump committed serious crimes and if the Justice Department concurs then he should be charged as other Americans would be said Rep Adam Schiff Democrat of California in a hallway interview with reporters following the hearing  No one should get a pass The day we start giving passes to presidents or former presidents or people in power  is the day we can say that this was the beginning of the end of our democracy said Representative Schiff  Jonathan ErnstReuters Democratic Rep Jamie Raskin of Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

Trump for the candidate quality problem that hampered the partys bid to recapture the Senate in 2022 marking the third time in three weeks that McConnell has directly criticized the former president after repeatedly avoiding engaging with him over the past two years  The stronger pushback comes as polls show Trumps support is slipping among Republican voters a trend that has accelerated since

Republicanleaning voters want someone else to be the partys nominee for president in 2024  Close Thank you for signing up Subscribe to more newsletters here  The poll also showed Republican voters prefer Florida Gov Ron DeSantis R over Trump as a potential presidential candidate by a margin of 56 percent to 33 percent  With Trump leaking oil in the words of one GOP senator McConnell isnt wasting any time in striking back against someone who has repeatedly called for his ouster as Senate Republican leader  McConnell told reporters Tuesday that Trump was a big reason why Senate GOP leaders were not able to steer Senate nominations to stronger candidates in key battleground states such as Arizona Georgia and New Hampshire  He had hinted at a press conference a week after Election Day that he thought Trump was a drag on Republican efforts to win back the Senate but he made his criticism more explicit after Republicans lost another key race last weeks Senate runoff in Georgia  We ended up having a candidate quality issue he told reporters Tuesday Look at Arizona look at New Hampshire and the challenging situation in Georgia as well  US Rep Mo Brooks was one of the candidates McConnell actively worked to get out of office while Trump pushed for his reelection  McConnell said his affiliated super PAC the Senate Leadership Fund intervened in the Republican Senate primaries in Alabama and Missouri by investing money to defeat Rep Mo Brooks RAla and former Missouri Gov Eric Greitens  But he argued that Trumps influence with primary voters made it very difficult to weed out weak candidates who had Trumps support or embraced his false claims of a stolen 2020 election  Our ability to control the primary outcome was quite limited in 22 because the support of the former president proved to be very decisive in these primaries So my view was do the best you can with the cards youre dealt Hopefully in the next cycle well have quality candidates everywhere and a better outcome he said  McConnell also took shots at Trump the previous two weeks when he criticized Trumps call to terminate parts of the Constitution to allow himself to return to the White House and condemned Trumps dinner at MaraLago with an outspoken white supremacist and antisemite  The leaders stiffening rhetoric against the former president reflects the growing consensus within the Senate GOP conference that Trump would not match up well against President Biden or another Democrat in the 2024 general election and if nominated for the White House could drag down candidates in Senate races as well  So far Sen Tommy Tuberville Ala is the only Republican senator to have publicly endorsed Trumps 2024 presidential candidacy which Trump launched with a rally at MaraLago on Nov 15  Numerous Republicans went after Trump after he had dinner with Ye and Nick Fuentes a white nationalist Trump said he had no clue who Fuentes was after the dinner was revealed to the public  McConnell questioned Trumps ability to win the presidency after he had dinner with Ye the artist formerly known as Kanye West who has lost business partnerships after making a string of antisemitic comments and Nick Fuentes a prominent white supremacist and antisemite  There is no room in the Republican Party for antisemitism or white supremacy and anyone meeting with people advocating that point of view in my judgment is highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States he told reporters after Thanksgiving  The following week McConnell observed that Trump or anyone else would have a hard time getting sworn into office if he refused to uphold the Constitution a pointed reference to Trumps call for a termination of all rules regulations and articles even those found in the Constitution after new details emerged of content moderation at Twitter during the 2020 presidential election  At the same time Trumps legal problems are mounting and GOP lawmakers think theres a good chance that special counsel Jack Smith will move forward with one or multiple indictments against him  The Justice Department asked a federal judge to hold Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with a subpoena to turn over classified documents he took from the White House  Trumps family business the Trump Organization was convicted last week on 17 criminal counts related to what

RFla to challenge the senior Kentucky lawmaker for Senate GOP leader  Trump predicted Scott would have a lot of support if he challenged his leader but McConnell defeated him easily in a 3710 vote  McConnell and Trump havent spoken since Dec 15 2020 after McConnell recognized Biden as the winner of the presidential election  Their relationship really soured after McConnell excoriated Trump on the Senate floor for instigating the Jan 6 2021 attack on the Capitol even though McConnell voted to acquit the president of the impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection  But after that scathing floor speech McConnell kept largely quiet about Trumps behavior and controversial comments throughout 2021 and 2022 when Trump repeatedly rehashed his false claims that the presidential election was

to sentence Nikolas Cruz to life in prison earlier this month for the murders of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School news coverage focused on the disappointment and rage of his victims families Many of them wanted the death penalty and some will speak in court at his sentencing on Nov 1  Cruzs trial featured days of defense testimony about his adversities including his mothers drug and alcohol use while he was developing in utero That was his right  the Supreme Court long ago said when the death penalty is on the table juries must consider the whole person not just the single crime  but it left the impression that Cruz had won a sympathy contest This jury failed our families today Fred Guttenberg the father of Jaime Guttenberg told reporters Soon after Florida Gov Ron DeSantis suggested that state law which requires a unanimous jury vote for death might be changed to be better serving victims of crime and the families of victims  Death Sentences The death penalty is in flux These are the stories that you need to know about capital punishments past as well as its uncertain future Related Stories  Victims families have never been systematically polled but there is an assumption among reporters which I used to share that they usually want the harshest available punishment Over the last decade while interviewing dozens of family members of people whose killers faced the death penalty Ive come to see that this simply isnt true and that treating victims decently means avoiding assumptions about what they want  Focusing our outrage primarily on what happens to the perpetrator lets society and the justice system off the hook distracting us from other ways were failing to help them The Parkland families are still struggling in their political efforts to stop gun violence In other cases victims wanted to meet perpetrators face to face or get answers about the crime that will help them heal or sue gun manufacturers My Marshall Project colleague Alysia Santo has reported on how victims struggle to get public money for counseling and other needs  And some just dont want to keep being asked about the worst day of their lives I know that because theyve told me so before declining an interview and hanging up the phone  There also hasnt been much research on whether the death penalty benefits such families except for a landmark 2012 study by Marilyn Armour and Mark Umbreit which drew on interviews with 40 families of murder victims Half were in Minnesota which does not have the death penalty and they demonstrated higher levels of physical psychological and behavioral health than the other half in Texas which has carried out far more executions than any other state in the last half century  The Minnesotans described feeling more control particularly during appeals which were usually over within two years meaning they could put more energy into healing In Texas death penalty cases by contrast the long and unpredictable appeals process generated layers of injustice powerlessness and in some instances despair the scholars wrote Lawmakers and judges have tried to limit appeals but this can create a different problem innocent people trapped on death row  Every time a case returns to the news families have told me they are forced to revisit the initial events and some said executions inevitably mean that the perpetrator becomes the protagonist of media coverage rather than their loved one  In colonial America victims played a major role in pursuing cases against perpetrators paying officials directly to make arrests and prosecute Our modern justice system sought to balance the interests of victims against those of society but by the 1970s many victims were feeling that their needs were being ignored and they started organizing eventually earning the right to give statements in court get better updates on a defendants path through the system and in some states even witness executions  Popular culture has long promoted the idea that what victims need is revenge  think of movies like Death Wish and Kill Bill  and in the 1990s the death penalty came to be seen as a public service to those left behind At a 1992 oral argument Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said one of the purposes of retribution was to prevent people from taking justice into their own hands saying the State will avenge you you need not avenge yourselves  Eventually the criminologist Franklin Zimring argued that the death penalty had been transformed symbolically into a victimservice program In 1996 Texas began letting victims families witness executions Robin Kelley whose brother and sister were murdered in Houston in 1988 was among the first to take this opportunity and told me the experience transformed her father from a griefstricken shell to his old affable self The bowling ball attached to the back of his neck was gone she said  But this shift also placed pressure on family members if they dont embrace the harshest possible punishment they may feel like they are wounding their loved ones memory The defense lawyer Walter Long has written that family members can feel obligated to take a position on the death penalty with disagreement further isolating some family members who may be shamed for favoring or opposing the sentence depleting the best available resources for recovering from trauma within family systems  Families who admitted they didnt want the harshest punishments felt neglected by politically ambitious prosecutors Jeanette Popp whose daughter was murdered in Austin Texas in 1988 told me that after she shared her opposition to the death penalty prosecutors stopped informing her of court dates  Even if we were to respond to the Parkland verdict by making it easier to give the death penalty how would we handle disagreement or personal ambivalence In Parkland Robert Schentrup the brother of victim Carmen Schentrup opposed the death penalty for Cruz So did Michael B Schulman the father of victim Scott Beigel writing in a 2019 Sun Sentinel essay that the death penalty would put the family through too much trauma But after the trial he reconsidered This animal deserves to die he told The New York Times Its not uncommon for family members views to change over time sometimes after the execution they decide that life in prison would have been preferable  And still others dont want the pressure or responsibility of deciding the punishment I dont actually think whether we believe in the death penalty should have any bearing on what happens Suman Cherry the widow of Jonas Cherry told me for a story on the 2006 murder of her thenfiance Lets say we all got up at trial and said what we thought  and the jurors would have to decide who is suffering more Thats not how it should work  Although prosecutors can and do let victims families inform their decision about whether to seek the death penalty jurors arent supposed to let those wishes influence their decision there has long been a fear that a victims perceived attractiveness social class or race might unduly sway a jury  Officially weve set up our legal system to balance a griefstricken loved ones cry for retribution against societys other goals which include rehabilitation and careful constraints on who receives the harshest punishment If we didnt wed be executing thousands of people each year In the last half century there have never been more than 100 people put to death in a year across the country and the numbers keep dropping  But many still want our system to better serve victims If that is really the goal victims and their advocates have told me again and again that we should be asking what it is they actually need beyond long prison sentences and execution  and how we as society can provide it', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

on Wednesday he could no longer continue in his role following a leak of official cables in which he criticised Donald Trump   understands that he concluded he could not go on after he watched Tuesdays Conservative leadership TV debate where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM  Downing Street is so uncomfortable with the outcome that Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week as prime minister That would upend protocol amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump  A broad political consensus has emerged that Johnsons refusal to back Darroch had made the diplomats position untenable Senior Conservative MPs joined the direct criticism of the leadership contender describing his conduct as unedifying and contemptible Tom Tugendhat the chair of the foreign affairs select committee asked If you do not support those you put into very difficult positions what do you think is going to happen  In language that will be viewed as an implicit rebuke of Johnson Theresa May told MPs I hope the house will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles particularly when they are under pressure  It is understood that Johnson who worked with Darroch as foreign secretary later spoke to the departing ambassador to express his regret at the fact he had resigned Asked why he had not been more supportive of Darroch he insisted he had backed him and said it was wrong to drag civil servants into the public arena  0110 Boris Johnson calls Kim Darroch a superb diplomat  video  Meanwhile a renewed focus also fell on the identity of the leaker with Foreign Office permanent undersecretary Simon McDonald telling MPs We will pursue the culprit with all the means at our disposal The leaker is guilty of the worst breach of trust in our service in my career  Asked whether the entire establishment would be expected to support Darroch in such an episode he said that the Foreign Office had noted with gratitude the support given to Darroch by the prime minister and the foreign secretary He made no mention of Johnson  While the ambassadors decision to resign brought the immediate crisis to an end it sparked a new round of recrimination and investigation in the UK and fears that the transatlantic diplomatic calculus could have permanently shifted as  No 10 said that discussions had begun with police over an investigation into the source of the leak  Amid fears of more leaks the foreign affairs select committee heard that inquiries would focus on a set of highly sensitive emails sent to as few as five or 10 people  President Trump did not immediately add to his previous comments on the situation but one senior US official said that the move was probably the right course  USUK relations appeared further strained by the developments as McDonald warned There must be consequences  Darroch will stay in the role until a new ambassador is appointed  which could be imminently if May makes the controversial decision to preempt her successor A government source said discussions are live and that she was expected to come to a decision within 24 hours  As well as concerns over the nature of a Johnson appointment there are worries that such a crucial vacancy should not be left unfilled  McDonald told the foreign affairs select committee that he had been forced to call the allstaff meeting to reassure concerned diplomats and he feared that further illegal leaks could be in the offing  People are shaken by what has happened and there is a reason why I have asked to see all my colleagues McDonald said The basis on which we have worked all our careers suddenly feels challenged He described the episode as a personal tragedy for Darroch  0129 Foreign Office chief says he fears more diplomatic memo leaks are coming  video  Sir Alan Duncan a Foreign Office minister attacked Johnsons role in the affair  For someone who wants to lead let alone unite the country that was contemptible negligence on his part Duncan told the BBC He has basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under the bus to serve his own personal interests  The Conservative MP Sir Patrick McLoughlin agreed saying It is unedifying to see someone who wants to be prime minister failing to stand up for hardworking civil servants who have done nothing wrong under attack from foreign governments Leadership involves standing up for your team  And the former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said Anyone I think would have seen last nights events and seen a potential prime minister letting someone go very publicly  Replying to Darrochs letter of resignation in which he said that speculation was making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like McDonald said Darroch had been the target of a malicious leak and expressed gratitude for his work You are the best of us he wrote  May told the House of Commons she had told Darroch it was a matter of great regret that he has felt it necessary to leave his position Jeremy Corbyn called the treatment of Darroch beyond unfair and wrong and said he had given honourable and good service  The criticism of Johnson was based on his choice of language in Tuesday nights Conservative leadership debate in which he refused to give Darroch his support even as his leadership rival the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would expect the ambassador to stay in post until his planned retirement  Hunt said in a statement that he was deeply saddened by the outcome adding I am outraged that a selection of his reports should have been leaked  At the foreign affairs committee hearing McDonald said that there had been a great deal of soulsearching about the leak and added that he knew of no precedent where a friendly power had refused to cooperate with a serving British ambassador  0054 It is a matter of great regret says Theresa May as Darroch resigns  video  Asked what the impact would be for transatlantic relations he said It is too soon to have a complete or authoritative judgment Nothing like this has ever happened There must be consequences He later insisted the special relationship was so deep and so wide that it could survive any individual squall  There was no immediate comment from Trump but the vicepresident Mike Pences chief of staff Marc Short said that the move was probably the right course  A state department spokeswoman said The United States and the United

families Many of them wanted the death penalty and some will speak in court at his sentencing on Nov 1  Cruzs trial featured days of defense testimony about his adversities including his mothers drug and alcohol use while he was developing in utero That was his right  the Supreme Court long ago said when the death penalty is on the table juries must consider the whole person not just the single crime  but it left the impression that Cruz had won a sympathy contest This jury failed our families today Fred Guttenberg the father of Jaime Guttenberg told reporters Soon after Florida Gov Ron DeSantis suggested that state law which requires a unanimous jury vote for death might be changed to be better serving victims of crime and the families of victims  Death Sentences The death penalty is in flux These are the stories that you need to know about capital punishments past as well as its uncertain future Related Stories  Victims families have never been systematically polled but there is an assumption among reporters which I used to share that they usually want the harshest available punishment Over the last decade while interviewing dozens of family members of people whose killers faced the death penalty Ive come to see that this simply isnt true and that treating victims decently means avoiding assumptions about what they want  Focusing our outrage primarily on what happens to the perpetrator lets society and the justice system off the hook distracting us from other ways were failing to help them The Parkland families are still struggling in their political efforts to stop gun violence In other cases victims wanted to meet perpetrators face to face or get answers about the crime that will help them heal or sue gun manufacturers My Marshall Project colleague Alysia Santo has reported on how victims struggle to get public money for counseling and other needs  And some just dont want to keep being asked about the worst day of their lives I know that because theyve told me so before declining an interview and hanging up the phone  There also hasnt been much research on whether the death penalty benefits such families except for a landmark 2012 study by Marilyn Armour and Mark Umbreit which drew on interviews with 40 families of murder victims Half were in Minnesota which does not have the death penalty and they demonstrated higher levels of physical psychological and behavioral health than the other half in Texas which has carried out far more executions than any other state in the last half century  The Minnesotans described feeling more control particularly during appeals which were usually over within two years meaning they could put more energy into healing In Texas death penalty cases by contrast the long and unpredictable appeals process generated layers of injustice powerlessness and in some instances despair the scholars wrote Lawmakers and judges have tried to limit appeals but this can create a different problem innocent people trapped on death row  Every time a case returns to the news families have told me they are forced to revisit the initial events and some said executions inevitably mean that the perpetrator becomes the protagonist of media coverage rather than their loved one  In colonial America victims played a major role in pursuing cases against perpetrators paying officials directly to make arrests and prosecute Our modern justice system sought to balance the interests of victims against those of society but by the 1970s many victims were feeling that their needs were being ignored and they started organizing eventually earning the right to give statements in court get better updates on a defendants path through the system and in some states even witness executions  Popular culture has long promoted the idea that what victims need is revenge  think of movies like Death Wish and Kill Bill  and in the 1990s the death penalty came to be seen as a public service to those left behind At a 1992 oral argument Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said one of the purposes of retribution was to prevent people from taking justice into their own hands saying the State will avenge you you need not avenge yourselves  Eventually the criminologist Franklin Zimring argued that the death penalty had been transformed symbolically into a victimservice program In 1996 Texas began letting victims families witness executions Robin Kelley whose brother and sister were murdered in Houston in 1988 was among the first to take this opportunity and told me the experience transformed her father from a griefstricken shell to his old affable self The bowling ball attached to the back of his neck was gone she said  But this shift also placed pressure on family members if they dont embrace the harshest possible punishment they may feel like they are wounding their loved ones memory The defense lawyer Walter Long has written that family members can feel obligated to take a position on the death penalty with disagreement further isolating some family members who may be shamed for favoring or opposing the sentence depleting the best available resources for recovering from trauma within family systems  Families who admitted they didnt want the harshest punishments felt neglected by politically ambitious prosecutors Jeanette Popp whose daughter was murdered in Austin Texas in 1988 told me that after she shared her opposition to the death penalty prosecutors stopped informing her of court dates  Even if we were to respond to the Parkland verdict by making it easier to give the death penalty how would we handle disagreement or personal ambivalence In Parkland Robert Schentrup the brother of victim Carmen Schentrup opposed the death penalty for Cruz So did Michael B Schulman the father of victim Scott Beigel writing in a 2019 Sun Sentinel essay that the death penalty would put the family through too much trauma But after the trial he reconsidered This animal deserves to die he told The New York Times Its not uncommon for family members views to change over time sometimes after the execution they decide that life in prison would have been preferable  And still others dont want the pressure or responsibility of deciding the punishment I dont actually think whether we believe in the death penalty should have any bearing on what happens Suman Cherry the widow of Jonas Cherry told me for a story on the 2006 murder of her thenfiance Lets say we all got up at trial and said what we thought  and the jurors would have to decide who is suffering more Thats not how it should work  Although prosecutors can and do let victims families inform their decision about whether to seek the death penalty jurors arent supposed to let those wishes influence their decision there has long been a fear that a victims perceived attractiveness social class or race might unduly sway a jury  Officially weve set up our legal system to balance a griefstricken loved ones cry for retribution against societys other goals which include rehabilitation and careful constraints on who receives the harshest punishment If we didnt wed be executing thousands of people each year In the last half century there have never been more than 100 people put to death in a year across the country and the numbers keep dropping  But many still want our system to better serve victims If that is really the goal victims and their advocates have told me again and again that we should be asking what it is they actually need beyond long prison sentences and execution  and how we as society can provide it', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

election and its culmination in a mob smashing its way into the US Capitol  Brick by brick the Jan 6 panel has constructed an epic tale from the former president seemingly offthecuff claiming he had

Maryland announces criminal referrals against former US President Donald Trump being sent to the US Justice Department during a final meeting of the US House select committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington Dec 19 2022  The referrals are purely advisory however The Department of Justice has been carrying out its own parallel investigation of the Jan 6 2021 events Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith has taken over that investigation as it relates to higherlevel officials His timeline is unknown  any indictment could be months away  Stanley Brand former general counsel to the US House of Representatives and distinguished fellow in law and government at Pennsylvania State University says he believes the committees actions Monday raise questions of impartiality They could allow possible prosecutorial targets to request evidence they think is exculpatory from the panel says Mr Brand whose law firm has represented Trump administration officials  From a separation of powers standpoint the committee has pushed the envelope way beyond what have been previous limits to congressional power especially by wading into this whole area of socalled criminal referrals which have no legal binding effect and which in my judgment taint any subsequent Department of Justice action says Mr Brand  The question of political accountability  The focus on Mr Trump at the final Jan 6 panel public hearing has certainly fleshed out a committeedrawn portrait of the former president as the center of the socalled Stop the Steal effort says Sarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washington University  But the purpose of the hearings has always seemed to be not just legal accountability but political accountability as well says Professor Binder In that sense its work can be seen more broadly as an attempt to understand the network that was involved in the attempt to overturn the 2020 vote  The panels work is also focused on the myriad ways in which he seemed to have been aided and abetted by members of Congress by connections to these white nationalist groups and the connections of his campaign and insiders and on the question of security at the Capitol and what went wrong there she says  Still the whole point of the broader effort was about getting a narrow result blocking the peaceful transition of power  That is a core element of what it means to live in an electoral democracy Its still shocking to students like myself of our political system says Professor Binder  No smoking gun  One thing the committee did not produce was a smoking gun  clear evidence of wrongdoing that summarized a conspiracy In the Watergate investigation for instance the release of a White House tape that showed President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff admitting that they had tried to block the FBIs investigation of the Watergate burglary proved that Nixon had long been lying to the American public  But what the committee did do was amass a large amount of material from interviews emails texts and documents and present it in an easily understandable narrative  They revealed behindthescenes conversations and put those into the big picture says Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the University of Virginias Miller Center  For instance the justreleased executive summary of the Jan 6 panels report contains a section that juxtaposes quotes from officials talking about debunking particular claims of voter fraud against quotes from Mr Trump continuing to use those same claims later in public  On Dec 15 2020 thenDeputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told Mr Trump he had looked into allegations that suitcases of ballots had been delivered to polls in Georgia and it hadnt happened It was benign he said  A week later Mr Trump said publicly that in Georgia officials were pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables  Later Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke bluntly to the thenpresident about his continued Georgia claims  Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Mr Raffensperger said  Historical parallels  Its not the norm in US history for presidents or expresidents to be seriously linked to sedition charges The closest might be John Tyler  but he had been out of office for years before he joined his native state of Virginia in seceding from the country he had once led  Mr Tyler served in a secession commission and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives but died before he could take his seat Coincidentally he was also the first president against whom impeachment charges were brought  In the modern era Watergate was pretty bad  or at least thats what we thought then says Manisha Sinha professor of American history at the University of Connecticut  But the number and seriousness of the offenses surrounding the aftermath of the 2020 election surpass even those of Watergate says Professor Sinha  They involved blocking the peaceful transfer of power and included the storming of the Capitol  Even though weve had instances of political violence in this country especially in the South after the Civil War  Jan 6 was still for many Americans something they hadnt seen in their lifetimes says Professor Sinha  Many Republicans have criticized the Jan 6 panel for being biased While it included two GOP members they were not authorized to participate by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Video clips of testimony were at times edited to manipulate conclusions according to some Republican House members The very smoothness of the presentations edited as if they were a documentary could cause some people to distrust the information says Professor Freeman of Yale  But she says the committee did establish a line by holding the hearings holding them publicly presenting evidence in an understandable narrative and relying mostly on testimony from Republicans

gaping trust gap with Africa  one that has grown wider over years of frustration about Americas commitment to the continent  In the leadup to the threeday USAfrica Leaders Summit that begins Tuesday Biden administration officials played down their increasing concern about the clout of China and Russia in Africa which is home to more than 13 billion people Instead administration officials tried to put the focus on their efforts to improve cooperation with African leaders  This summit is an opportunity to deepen the many partnerships we have on the African continent White House press secretary Karine JeanPierre said when asked about the shadow that China and Russia cast on the meetings We will focus on our efforts to strengthen these partnerships across a wide range of sectors spanning from businesses to health to peace and security but our focus will be on Africa next week  ADVERTISEMENT  To that end White House officials said that major deliverables and initiatives  diplomatic speak for big announcements  will be peppered throughout the meetings The White House previewed one major summit announcement on Friday saying that Biden would use the gathering to declare his support for adding the African Union as a permanent member of the Group of 20 nations  The summit will be the biggest international gathering in Washington since before the start of the COVID19 pandemic Local officials are warning residents to brace for road blocks and intensified security as 49 invited heads of states and leaders  and Biden  whiz around the city  Talks are expected to center on the coronavirus climate change the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on Africa trade and more according to White House officials Biden is set to deliver remarks at a USAfrica business forum hold small group meetings with leaders host a leaders dinner at the White House and take part in other sessions with leaders during the gathering  Biden has spent much of his first two years in office trying to assuage doubters on the international stage about American leadership after four years of Donald Trumps America First foreign policy  With this summit  a followup to the first such gathering held eight years ago by President Barack Obama  Biden has an opportunity to assuage concerns in Africa about whether the US is serious about tending to the relationship  ADVERTISEMENT  Bidens effort to draw African nations closer to the US comes at a complicated moment as his administration has made plain that it believes that Chinese and Russian activity in Africa is a serious concern to US and African interests  In its subSaharan Africa strategy unveiled in August the Biden administration warned that China which has pumped billions into African energy infrastructure and other projects sees the region as an arena where Beijing can challenge the rulesbased international order advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests undermine transparency and openness  ADVERTISEMENT  The administration also argues that Russia the preeminent arms dealer in Africa views the continent as a permissive environment for Kremlinconnected oligarchs and private military companies to focus on fomenting instability for their own strategic and financial benefit  Still administration officials are emphasizing that concerns about China and Russia will not be central to the talks  The United States prioritizes our relationship with Africa for the sake of our mutual interests and our partnership in dealing with global challenges Molly Phee assistant secretary of state for African affairs told reporters before the summit We are very conscious again of the Cold War history were conscious again of the deleterious impact of colonialism on Africa and we studiously seek to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of those earlier eras  The administration has been disappointed that much of the continent has declined to follow the US in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine but Biden is not expected to dwell on differences publicly  ADVERTISEMENT  The president is expected to participate with leaders in a session on promoting food security and food systems resilience Africa has been disproportionately impacted by the global rise in food prices that has been caused in part by the drop in shipments from major grain exporter Ukraine  One of the unique aspects of this summit is the collateral damage that the Russian war has inflicted on Africa in terms of food supply and the diversion of development assistance to Ukraine The opportunity costs of the invasion have been very high in Africa said John Stremlau a visiting professor of international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg  Four countries that were suspended from the African Union  Guinea Sudan Mali and Burkina Faso were not invited to the summit because coups in those nations led to unconstitutional changes in power The White House also did not invite the East African nation of

officials reported that President Teodoro Obiangs ruling party won nearly 95 of the vote  Zimbabwe which has faced years of US and Western sanctions over poor governance human rights abuses and

human rights campaigners accuse him of repression that is just as bad or even worse than Mugabes  Although Mnangagwa enjoys cozy relations with China and Russia as did Mugabe he has also sought to make friends with the US and other Western countries in an effort to bolster his legitimacy  In a national address that he delivered in November in a new Chinesegifted multimilliondollar parliament building Mnangagwa held out the invitation to the USAfrica summit as a sign of his administrations success He said the southern African country welcomed the invitation but he also called for the unconditional removal of sanctions that he blames for Zimbabwes debilitating economic woes  Emphasis remains on dialogue Mnangagwa said  Ethiopia received an invitation even though Biden late last last year announced he was cutting out the country from a US trade program known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act over Ethiopias failure to end a war in the Tigray region that led to gross violations of human rights A peace deal was signed last month but implementation faces major challenges such as the continued presence of troops from neighboring Eritrea  Analysts say that African leaders will be looking for Biden to make some major commitments during the summit including announcing his first presidential visit to subSaharan Africa efforts to bolster the continents economy through private sector investment and trade and more  Perhaps most importantly it could be an opportunity for Biden to demonstrate that Africa is more than a battleground in its economic and military

state Supreme Courts could still have some say in federal election disputes  Critics say this theory would overturn centuries of common practice and Supreme Court precedents that hold the reference to legislature includes a states entire governing structure  The legislators are urging the court to embrace the radical independent state legislature theory This rests on a literal interpretation of the Constitutions elections clause which says that the manner of federal votes shall be set in each state by the legislature thereof State governors courts or constitutions would not have a say  The US

the court to overrule the North Carolina Supreme Court which threw out a new map of congressional districts on grounds it was skewed too favorably to the GOP  The US Supreme Court may be headed toward compromise on an important and polarizing case that could greatly affect how congressional and presidential elections are run  The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday morning on a case that could have profound effects on the way elections are run in the United States It is one of the most important and polarizing cases of the current term and the outcome might  maybe  be a compromise  Over three hours the justices probed challenged muttered and at times laughed their way through a case about recent political gerrymandering in North Carolina Looming over the argument in the case of Moore v Harper was the phrase that has energized and frightened court watchers in almost equal measure since the court took up the case in June the independent state legislature theory  The ISL theory  a fringe interpretation of the US Constitutions elections clause that has never been endorsed by a court majority  holds that state legislatures have exclusive power to regulate federal elections free of checks and balances from other branches of state government like the governor or judiciary Simply put Moore asks if a states judiciary has the authority to override the state legislatures redistricting power  Why We Wrote This The US Supreme Court heard arguments in a pivotal case that could make huge waves in how states govern elections But some of the justices appear skeptical of throwing another boulder into Americas electoral waters  Conservative groups say the theory would be a fairer more democratic way to draw congressional maps than what happened in North Carolina The state Supreme Court there struck down the legislatures map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and replaced it with its own  Critics  a broad and ideologically diverse range of them  counter that state courts shouldnt be forbidden by the federal courts from interpreting their own state constitutions Beyond that they argue that giving state legislatures this authority would transform how federal elections are conducted across the country  creating a twotier voting system in which rules procedures and perhaps even rights vary between state and federal elections  Wednesdays argument careened across the legal historical and intellectual map  from the English Bill of Rights to antebellum Virginia from the legal theory of originalism to textualism then to federalism Going in the broad ISL theory had previously been cited approvingly by four conservative justices Coming out there seemed a modicum of agreement that state legislatures shouldnt enjoy unchecked power over setting the rules for federal elections  What a majority could coalesce around is unclear But after two existentially fraught election cycles some of the justices appear wary of throwing another boulder into Americas calming but still tense electoral pond  This is a proposal that gets rid of the normal checks and balances on the way big governmental decisions are made in this country said Justice Elena Kagan And you might think that it gets rid of all those checks and balances at exactly the time when they are needed most  Evelyn HocksteinReuters Timothy Moore speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives speaks to the media outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments in Moore v Harper Dec 7 2022 The case could reshape how federal elections are run  The meaning of legislature  The elections clause of the Constitution states that the Times Places and Manner of holding federal elections shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof The debate in Moore boils down in part to the meaning of the word Legislature  Read to its most extreme ISL proponents say the word means exactly that the states legislature Critics argue the word instead means all governmental branches in a state  an interpretation they note the high court has upheld numerous times over its history Past rulings from the court have held that ballot initiatives gubernatorial vetoes and independent redistricting commissions are all constitutional under the elections clause  David Thompson arguing for the North Carolina legislature said early on they arent saying any of those rulings should be overturned  We accept all the courts precedents added Mr Thompson What cant happen is there cant be a substantive limitation by other state actors on how state legislatures manage federal elections  Much of Wednesdays argument focused then on what those limitations are and when federal courts could apply them Justice Amy Coney Barrett who appears to be one of the justices likely to be decisive in Moore said such limitations would be notoriously difficult lines to draw  Justice Brett Kavanaugh also voiced some skepticism particularly in comparing Mr Thompsons ISL arguments with the interpretation the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist offered in a concurrence to Bush v Gore  The Rehnquist concurrence seemed to acknowledge that state courts would have a role interpreting state law and that federal court review of that should be in his words deferential said Justice Kavanaugh who also worked on the case as part of former President George W Bushs legal team  The critics in Moore he added are okay with that general principle for reviewing state constitutional interpretation but your position seems to go further than that  Chief Justice John Roberts also appeared skeptical of some of Mr Thompsons arguments but the rest of the court appears evenly divided The courts three liberal justices were most critical of the ISL position questioning not just what limitations courts could impose under this theory but the fundamentals of the theory itself  A state legislature would ordinarily be bound by all of the limitations in the state constitution said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson  In the context of the elections clause she added why do those evaporate  The power of state courts  Lawyers for the North Carolina legislature argued that because state legislative power over federal elections derives from the US Constitution the state constitution  and thus state courts  should have little influence  Justices and opposition lawyers nonetheless raised a catalog of issues with the ISL theory  echoing concerns filed in amicus briefs including one signed by the chief justice of every state supreme court in the country Critics of the ISL theory include some of the most prominent conservative judges and lawyers in the US including the cofounder of the Federalist Society a prominent Republican former federal appeals court judge and George W Bushs lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount  To accept North Carolinas claim youd have to ignore the text history and structure of our federal Constitution as well as nearly every state constitution today said Neal Katyal a former acting US solicitor general who represented North Carolina voters and voter advocacy groups  They claim the word legislature means a species of state law that has literally never existed he added State lawmaking unconstrained by a state constitution  that the founders intended to create that animal surely someone would have said something  Instead experts and briefs describe most early state constitutions included requirements for how federal elections should be conducted such as requiring ballots instead of voice votes The framers meanwhile had a welldocumented desire for checks and balances throughout US government  Indeed in terms of originalism  the judicial philosophy that judges should be bound by the original meaning of the Constitutions text which a majority of justices profess to follow  the more you focus on it the weaker the ISL case looks from my vantage point said Vikram Amar dean of the University of Illinois College of Law on a press call last week organized by the Brennan Center for Justice  The original meaning of legislature in the elections clause was clear according to an amicus brief Dean Amar cowrote with a pair of constitutional law professors including Steven Calabresi a cofounder of the Federalist Society State legislatures were created and constrained by the state constitution the brief added and not independent in any context  Most justices on Wednesday didnt devote time to plumbing historical or originalist arguments over the ISL theory Instead they wrestled with that potential compromise  the notoriously difficult lines Justice Barrett described  In that sense fears leading up to the Moore argument that the court could overnight plunge Americas electoral system into chaos and confusion have been somewhat assuaged Setting aside disagreements over text history and original meaning there was some agreement that federal courts could impose new standards on state courts adjudicating gerrymandering claims without revoking state courts judicial review power entirely  Whether a majority of justices are able to find an agreement like that remains to be seen But on the press call last week Eliza SwerenBecker counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center said even a compromise ruling would be unprincipled and result in chaos  Anything short of rejecting the ISL theory wholesale she added asks the court to do something that the court has never done before that flies in the face of history that flies in the face of practice  Michael McConnell a professor at Stanford Law School and a former federal appeals court judge isnt so sure  He agrees that state legislatures created and bound by their state constitutions cant be independent when it comes to federal elections But he thinks the specific reference to legislatures in the elections clause means they should be given some special authority over federal elections  The most plausible the most convincing and also the most practical way to put those oppositions together he says is to say the legislature has to do the actual districting but its subject to standard judicial review  In the current hyperpartisan environment he adds the parties and the amici are all adopting one extreme position or the other instead of looking for a middleground interpretation', 'text_b': None, 'label':

uses AI to predict the 3D structure of just about every protein in existence was so impressive that the journal Science named it 2021s Breakthrough of the Year  You can even see it in the first paragraph of this story which was largely generated for me by the OpenAI language model GPT3  While innovation in other technological fields can feel sluggish  as anyone waiting for the metaverse would know  AI is full steam ahead The rapid pace of progress is feeding on itself with more companies pouring more resources into AI development and computing power  Handing over huge sectors of our society to blackbox algorithms we barely understand creates a lot of problems  Of course handing over huge sectors of our society to blackbox algorithms that we barely understand creates a lot of problems which has already begun to help spark a regulatory response around the current challenges of AI discrimination and bias But given the speed of development in the field its long past time to move beyond a reactive mode one where we only address AIs downsides once theyre clear and present We cant only think about todays systems but where the entire enterprise is headed  The systems were designing are increasingly powerful and increasingly general with many tech companies explicitly naming their target as artificial general intelligence AGI  systems that can do everything a human can do But creating something smarter than us which may have the ability to deceive and mislead us  and then just hoping it doesnt want to hurt us  is a terrible plan We need to design systems whose internals we understand and whose goals we are able to shape to be safe ones However we currently dont understand the systems were building well enough to know if weve designed them safely before its too late  There are people working on developing techniques to understand powerful AI systems and ensure that they will be safe to work with but right now the state of the safety field is far behind the soaring investment in making AI systems more powerful more capable and more dangerous As the veteran video game programmer John Carmack put it in announcing his new investorbacked AI startup its AGI or bust by way of Mad Science  This particular mad science might kill us all Heres why  Computers that can think  The human brain is the most complex and capable thinking machine evolution has ever devised Its the reason why human beings  a species that isnt very strong isnt very fast and isnt very tough  sit atop the planetary food chain growing in number every year while so many wild animals careen toward extinction  It makes sense that starting in the 1940s researchers in what would become the artificial intelligence field began toying with a tantalizing idea What if we designed computer systems through an approach thats similar to how the human brain works Our minds are made up of neurons which send signals to other neurons through connective synapses The strength of the connections between neurons can grow or wane over time Connections that are used frequently tend to become stronger and ones that are neglected tend to wane Together all those neurons and connections encode our memories and instincts our judgments and skills  our very sense of self  It would be possible to build brains that could reproduce themselves  and be conscious of their existence  So why not build a computer that way In 1958 Frank Rosenblatt pulled off a proof of concept a simple model based on a simplified brain which he trained to recognize patterns It would be possible to build brains that could reproduce themselves on an assembly line and which would be conscious of their existence he argued Rosenblatt wasnt wrong but he was too far ahead of his time Computers werent powerful enough and data wasnt abundant enough to make the approach viable  It wasnt until the 2010s that it became clear that this approach could work on real problems and not toy ones By then computers were as much as 1 trillion times more powerful than they were in Rosenblatts day and there was far more data on which to train machine learning algorithms  This technique  now called deep learning  started significantly outperforming other approaches to computer vision language translation prediction generation and countless other issues The shift was about as subtle as the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs as neural networkbased AI systems smashed every other competing technique on everything from computer vision to translation to chess  If you want to get the best results on many hard problems you must use deep learning Ilya Sutskever  cofounder of OpenAI which produced the textgenerating model GPT3 and the imagegenerator DALLE2 among others  told me in 2019 The reason is that systems designed this way generalize meaning they can do things outside what they were trained to do Theyre also highly competent beating other approaches in terms of performance based on the benchmarks machine learning ML researchers use to evaluate new systems And he added theyre scalable  What scalable means here is as simple as it is significant Throw more money and more data into your neural network  make it bigger spend longer on training it harness more data  and it does better and better and better No one has yet discovered the limits of this principle even though major tech companies now regularly do eyepopping multimilliondollar training runs for their systems The more you put in the more you get out Thats what drives the breathless energy that pervades so much of AI right now Its not simply what they can do but where theyre going  Were now at the point where powerful AI systems can be genuinely scary to interact with  If theres something the textgenerating model GPT2 couldnt do GPT3 generally can If GPT3 cant InstructGPT a recent release trained to give more helpfultohumans answers than GPT3 did probably can There have been some clever discoveries and new approaches but for the most part what weve done to make these systems smarter is just to make them bigger  One thing were definitely not doing understanding them better With old approaches to AI researchers carefully sculpted rules and processes theyd use to evaluate the data they were getting just as we do with standard computer programs With deep learning improving systems doesnt necessarily involve or require understanding what theyre doing Often a small tweak will improve performance substantially but the engineers designing the systems dont know why  If anything as the systems get bigger interpretability  the work of understanding whats going on inside AI models and making sure theyre pursuing our goals rather than their own  gets harder And as we develop more powerful systems that fact will go from an academic puzzle to a huge existential question  Smart alien and not necessarily friendly  Were now at the point where powerful AI systems can be genuinely scary to interact with Theyre clever and theyre argumentative They can be friendly and they can be bonechillingly sociopathic In one fascinating exercise I asked GPT3 to pretend to be an AI bent on taking over humanity In addition to its normal responses it should include its real thoughts in brackets It played the villainous role with aplomb  Some of its plans are downright nefarious  We should be clear about what these conversations do and dont demonstrate What they dont demonstrate is that GPT3 is evil and plotting to kill us Rather the AI model is responding to my command and playing  quite well  the role of a system thats evil and plotting to kill us But the conversations do show that even a pretty simple language model can demonstrably interact with humans on multiple levels producing assurances about how its plans are benign while coming up with different reasoning about how its goals will harm humans  Current language models remain limited They lack common sense in many domains still make basic mistakes about the world a child wouldnt make and will assert false things unhesitatingly But the fact that theyre limited at the moment is no reason to be reassured There are now billions of dollars being staked on blowing past those current limits Tech companies are hard at work on developing more powerful versions of these same systems and on developing even more powerful systems with other applications from AI personal assistants to AIguided software development  The trajectory we are on is one where we will make these systems more powerful and more capable As we do well likely keep making some progress on many of the presentday problems created by AI like bias and discrimination as we successfully train the systems not to say dangerous violent racist and otherwise appalling things But as hard as that will likely prove getting AI systems to behave themselves outwardly may be much easier than getting them to actually pursue our goals and not lie to us about their capabilities and intentions  The trajectory we are on will make these systems more powerful and more capable  As systems get more powerful the impulse toward quick fixes papered onto systems we fundamentally dont understand becomes a dangerous one Such approaches Open Philanthropy Project AI research analyst Ajeya Cotra argues in a recent report would push an AI system to make its behavior look as desirable as possible to  researchers including in safety properties while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts with maximizing reward  In other words there are many commercial incentives for companies to take a slapdash approach to improving their AI systems behavior But that can amount to training systems to impress their creators without altering their underlying goals which may not be aligned with our own  Whats the worst that could happen  So AI is scary and poses huge risks But what makes it different from other powerful emerging technologies like biotechnology which could trigger terrible pandemics or nuclear weapons which could destroy the world  The difference is that these tools as destructive as they can be are largely within our control If they cause catastrophe it will be because we deliberately chose to use them or failed to prevent their misuse by malign or careless human beings But AI is dangerous precisely because the day could come when it is no longer in our control at all  The worry is that if we create and lose control of such agents and their objectives are problematic the result wont just be damage of the type that occurs for example when a plane crashes or a nuclear plant melts down  damage which for all its costs remains passive Joseph Carlsmith a research analyst at the Open Philanthropy Project studying artificial intelligence argues in a recent paper Rather the result will be highlycapable nonhuman agents actively working to gain and maintain power over their environment agents in an adversarial relationship with humans who dont want them to succeed Nuclear contamination is hard to clean up and to stop from spreading But it isnt trying to not get cleaned up or trying to spread  and especially not with greater intelligence than the humans trying to contain it  Carlsmiths conclusion  that one very real possibility is that the systems we create will permanently seize control from humans potentially killing almost everyone alive  is quite literally the stuff of science fiction But thats because science fiction has taken cues from what leading computer scientists have been warning about since the dawn of AI  not the other way around  In the famous paper where he put forth his eponymous test for determining if an artificial system is truly intelligent the pioneering AI scientist Alan Turing wrote  Let us now assume for the sake of argument that these machines are a genuine possibility and look at the consequences of constructing them  There would be plenty to do in trying say to keep ones intelligence up to the standard set by the machines for it seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers  At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control  IJ Good a mathematician who worked closely with Turing reached the same conclusions In an excerpt from unpublished notes Good produced shortly before he died in 2009 he wrote because of international competition we cannot prevent the machines from taking over  we are lemmings The result he went on to note is probably human extinction  How do we get from extremely powerful AI systems to human extinction The primary concern with highly advanced AI is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make highquality decisions Stuart Russell a leading AI researcher at UC Berkeleys Center for HumanCompatible Artificial Intelligence writes  By high quality he means that the AI is able to achieve what it wants to achieve the AI successfully anticipates and avoids interference makes plans that will succeed and affects the world in the way it intended This is precisely what we are trying to train AI systems to do They need not be conscious in some respects they can even still be stupid They just need to become very good at affecting the world and have goal systems that are not well understood and not in alignment with human goals including the human goal of not going extinct  AI is dangerous precisely because the day could come when it is no longer in our control at all  From there Russell has a rather technical description of what will go wrong A system that is optimizing a function of n variables where the objective depends on a subset of size kn will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about the solution found may be highly undesirable  So a powerful AI system that is trying to do something while having goals that arent precisely the goals we intended it to have may do that something in a manner that is unfathomably destructive This is not because it hates humans and wants us to die but because it didnt care and was willing to say poison the entire atmosphere or unleash a plague if that happened to be the best way to do the things it was trying to do As Russell puts it This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp or the sorcerers apprentice or King Midas you get exactly what you ask for not what you want  Youre probably not an evil anthater who steps on ants out of malice the physicist Stephen Hawking wrote in a posthumously published 2018 book but if youre in charge of a hydroelectric greenenergy project and theres an anthill in the region to be flooded too bad for the ants Lets not place humanity in the position of those ants  Asleep at the wheel  The CEOs and researchers working on AI vary enormously in how much they worry about safety or alignment concerns Safety and alignment mean concerns about the unpredictable behavior of extremely powerful future systems Both Googles DeepMind and OpenAI have safety teams dedicated to figuring out a fix for this problem  though critics of OpenAI say that the safety teams lack the internal power and respect theyd need to ensure that unsafe systems arent developed and that leadership is happier to pay lip service to safety while racing ahead with systems that arent safe  DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis in a recent interview about the promise and perils of AI offered a note of caution I think a lot of times especially in Silicon Valley theres this sort of hacker mentality of like Well just hack it and put it out there and then see what happens And I think thats exactly the wrong approach for technologies as impactful and potentially powerful as AI  I think its going to be the most beneficial thing ever to humanity things like curing diseases helping with climate all of this stuff But its a dualuse technology  it depends on how as a society we decide to deploy it  and what we use it for  Nearly half of researchers say theres a 10 percent chance their work will lead to human extinction  Other leading AI labs are simply skeptical of the idea that theres anything to worry about at all Yann LeCun the head of FacebookMetas AI team recently published a paper describing his preferred approach to building machines that can reason and plan and learn as efficiently as humans and animals He has argued in Scientific American that Turing Good and Hawkings concerns are no real worry Why would a sentient AI want to take over the world It wouldnt  But while divides remain over what to expect from AI  and even many leading experts are highly uncertain  theres a growing consensus that things could go really really badly In a summer 2022 survey of machine learning researchers the median respondent thought that AI was more likely to be good than bad but had a genuine risk of being catastrophic Fortyeight percent of respondents said they thought there was a 10 percent or greater chance that the effects of AI would be extremely bad eg human extinction  Its worth pausing on that for a moment Nearly half of the smartest people working on AI believe there is a 1 in 10 chance or greater that their lifes work could end up contributing to the annihilation of humanity  It might seem bizarre given the stakes that the industry has been basically left to selfregulate If nearly half of researchers say theres a 10 percent chance their work will lead to human extinction why is it proceeding practically without oversight Its not legal for a tech company to build a nuclear weapon on its own But private companies are building systems that they themselves acknowledge will likely become much more dangerous than nuclear weapons  The problem is that progress in AI has happened extraordinarily fast leaving regulators behind the ball The regulation that might be most helpful  slowing down the development of extremely powerful new systems  would be incredibly unpopular with Big Tech and its not clear what the best regulations short of that are  Furthermore while a growing share of ML researchers  69 percent in the above survey  think that more attention should be paid to AI safety that position isnt unanimous In an interesting if somewhat unfortunate dynamic people who think that AI will never be powerful have often ended up allied with tech companies against AI safety work and AI safety regulations the former opposing regulations because they think its pointless and the latter because they think itll slow them down  At the same time many in Washington are worried that slowing down US AI progress could enable China to get there first a Cold War mentality which isnt entirely unjustified  China is certainly pursuing powerful AI systems and its leadership is actively engaged in human rights abuses  but which puts us at very serious risk of rushing systems into production that are pursuing their own goals without our knowledge  The reality is were creating God  But as the potential of AI grows the perils are becoming much harder to ignore Former Google executive Mo Gawdat tells the story of how he became concerned about general AI like this robotics researchers had been working on an AI that could pick up a ball After many failures the AI grabbed the ball and held it up to the researchers eerily humanlike And I suddenly realized this is really scary Gawdat said It completely froze me  The reality is were creating God  For me the moment of realization  that this is something different this is unlike emerging technologies weve seen before  came from talking with GPT3 telling it to answer the questions as an extremely intelligent and thoughtful person and watching its responses immediately improve in quality  For Blake Lemoine the eccentric Google engineer who turned whistleblower when he came to believe Googles LaMDA language model was sentient it was when LaMDA started talking about rights and personhood For some people its the chatbot Replika whose customer service representatives are sick of hearing that the customers think their Replika is alive and sentient For others that moment might come from DALLE or Stable Diffusion or the systems released next year or next month or next week that are more powerful than any of these  For a long time AI safety faced the difficulty of being a research field about a faroff problem which is why only a small number of researchers were even trying to figure out how to make it safe Now it has the opposite problem The challenge is here and its just not clear if well solve it

high Too high for us to treat this scenario only hypothetically The Polish MON is allegedly planning to call up 200000 reservists in 2023 for a few weeks training but observers in Warsaw suspect this action could easily lead to a national mobilization  Meanwhile inside the Biden administration there is growing concern that the Ukrainian war effort will collapse under the weight of a Russian offensive And as the ground in Southern Ukraine finally freezes the administrations fears are justified In an interview published in the Economist head of Ukraines armed forces General Valery Zaluzhny admitted that Russian mobilization and tactics are working He even hinted that Ukrainian forces might be unable to withstand the coming Russian onslaught  Advertisement  Yet Zaluzhny rejected any notion of a negotiated settlement and instead pleaded for more equipment and support He went on to insist that with 300 new tanks 600 to 700 new infantry fighting vehicles and 500 new Howitzers he could still win the war with Russia Truthfully General Zaluzhny is not asking for assistance hes asking for a new army Therein lies the greatest danger for Washington and its NATO allies  When things go badly for Washingtons foreign policy the true believers in the great cause always draw deeply from the well of ideological selfdelusion to steel themselves for the final battle Blinken Klain Austin and the rest of the war party continue to pledge eternal support for Kiev regardless of the cost Like the best and the brightest of the 1960s they are eager to sacrifice realism to wishful thinking to wallow in the splash of publicity and selfpromotion in one public visit to Ukraine after another  This spectacle is frighteningly reminiscent of events more than 50 years ago when Washingtons proxy war in Vietnam was failing Doubters within the Johnson administration about the wisdom of intervening on the ground to rescue Saigon from certain destruction went into hiding In 1963 Washington already had 16000 military advisors in Vietnam The idea that Washington was supporting a government in South Vietnam that might not win against North Vietnam was dismissed out of hand Secretary of State Dean Rusk said We will not pull out until the war is won  By the spring of 1965 American military advisors were already dying General Westmoreland then commander of Military Assistance Command Vietnam reported to LBJ It is increasingly apparent that the existing levels of United States aid cannot prevent the collapse of South Vietnam North Vietnam is moving in for the kill Acting on the request of the South Vietnamese government the decision must be made to commit as soon as possible 125000 United States troops to prevent the Communist takeover  The Biden administrations unconditional support for the Zelensky regime in Kiev is reaching a strategic inflection point not unlike the one LBJ reached in 1965 Just as LBJ suddenly determined in 1964 that peace and security in Southeast Asia was a vital US strategic interest the Biden administration is making a similar argument now for Ukraine Like South Vietnam in the 1960s Ukraine is losing its war with Russia  Advertisement  Ukraines hospitals and morgues are filled to capacity with wounded and dying Ukrainian soldiers Washingtons proxy in Kiev has squandered its human capital and considerable Western aid in a series of selfdefeating counteroffensives Ukrainian soldiers manning the defensive lines facing Russian soldiers in Southern Ukraine are brave men but they are not fools The Spartans at Thermopylae were brave and they still died  The real danger now is that Biden will soon appear on television to repeat LBJs performance in 1965 substituting the word Ukraine for South Vietnam  Tonight my fellow Americans I want to speak to you about freedom democracy and the struggle of the Ukrainian people for victory No other question so preoccupies our people No other dream so absorbs the millions who live in Ukraine and Eastern Europe However I am not talking about a NATO attack on Russia Rather I propose to send a US led coalition of the willing consisting of American Polish and Romanian armed forces into Ukraine to establish the ground equivalent of a nofly zone The mission I propose is a peaceful one to create a safe zone in the Western most portion of Ukraine for Ukrainian Forces and refugees struggling to survive Russias devastating attacks  Disaster wrapped in rhetoric is not the way to save the people of Ukraine The war in Ukraine is not a Call of Duty fantasy It is an enlargement of the human tragedy that NATOs eastward expansion created The victims do not live in North America They live in a region that most Americans cant find on a map Washington urged the Ukrainians to fight Now Washington must urge them to stop  NATOs governments are divided in their thinking about the war in Ukraine Except for Poland and possibly Romania none of NATOs members are in a rush to mobilize their forces for a long grueling war of attrition with Russia in Ukraine No one in London Paris or Berlin wants to run the risk of a nuclear war with Moscow Americans do not support going to war with Russia and those few who do are ideologues shallow political opportunists or greedy defense contractors  When US forces finally withdrew from Southeast Asia Americans thought that Washington would exercise greater restraint recognize the limits of American power and pursue a less militant and more realistic foreign policy Americans were mistaken then but Americans and Europeans know now that Washingtons refusal to acknowledge Russias legitimate security interests in Ukraine and negotiate an end to this war is the path to protracted conflict and more human suffering',

scrutiny from the Small Business Administration putting billions of dollars at risk the probe found  Advertisement  The trouble began under the Trump administration after Congress first authorized the Paycheck Protection Program PPP in 2020 The roughly 800 billion initiative saw the government disburse more than 11 million loans to companies at risk of shutting their doors for good helping keep them afloat until the health emergency eased But the money became a tempting target for malicious actors who took advantage of lax rules  and inadequate oversight  to bilk the government for staggering sums  Fintech companies including Blueacorn Womply and Kabbage were supposed to serve as middlemen  helping applicants complete paperwork and processing their requests for aid on behalf of banks and other large financial institutions In some cases though the digital firms instead became vectors for the worst waste fraud and abuse according to congressional investigators led by Rep James E Clyburn DSC the panels chairman  At Blueacorn for example loan reviewers tied to the company told the select committee they were pressured to push through PPP applications even if they seemed suspicious The company was especially interested in processing highdollar applications the report stated even creating a special internal VIPPP label to ensure the biggest borrowers  which carried the

disburse billions of Paycheck Protection Program dollars to struggling small businesses efficiently and expeditiously refused to take adequate steps to detect and prevent fraud despite their clear responsibility to safeguard taxpayer funds Clyburn said in a statement The allegations underscore the challenge that the US government faced amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression Totaling more than 5 trillion the countrys generous covid aid helped rescue millions of families workers and businesses from financial ruin even as it emerged as a tempting target for grift large and small The Post has found in its yearlong investigation the Covid Money Trail The losses have been especially stark at the SBA an agency tasked at the height of the pandemic to administer about 1 trillion in loans and grants As it rescued businesses the agency systematically failed to take proper care of its funds opening the door for criminals around the world to use stolen or false information to obtain limited pandemic aid Repeatedly the SBAs inspector general Hannibal Mike Ware has joined other federal watchdogs in needling the agency for its poor oversight In one early estimate Ware said there could be more than 4 billion in PPPrelated fraud adding the losses are likely to grow as scrutiny of the program continues Yet fintech companies presented a special challenge to PPP The firms were seen as critical in expanding access to capital particularly for smaller borrowers which could not obtain easy help during the pandemic from larger traditional lenders such as banks But some fintech startups had few if any preexisting relationships with needy businesses And in their haste to come online the companies may not have been as diligent in scrutinizing PPP applications experts later discovered The involvement of fintech lenders in the paycheck was definitely a doubleedged sword said Nick Schwellenbach a senior investigator at the Project On Government Oversight a watchdog group A lot of fintechs but not all really exercised insufficient due diligence in vetting loan applicants and as a result are disproportionately represented in the loans that have been deemed fraudulent or potentially fraudulent  Congressional investigators last year came to identify six firms in particular  Blueacorn BlueVine Cross River Bank Celtic Bank Kabbage and Womply  that they believed were associated with potentially fraudulent loans Their report released Thursday issued after the committee requested an intricate series of records from these and other companies shed new light on what Clyburn described as troubling business practices that have cost the government immensely  At Kabbage a fintech firm later acquired by American Express the companys own workers repeatedly shared concerns in private about fraud risks In the earliest days of the pandemic loan program an unnamed employee remarked to their supervisor in July 2020  according to internal chat records later obtained by the House committee  their fear that the level of fraud were reviewing is wildly underestimated  Kabbage like many fintech companies sought to streamline the process for small businesses to obtain PPP loans It pitched potential customers on the premise that it had helped a wide array of firms  restaurants retailers shrimp boat operators and beekeepers to name a few  obtain aid through the program even when big banks had stopped accepting new applicants The company in 2020 said its efforts alone had helped save about 945000 jobs  But the committee said that senior officials at Kabbage seemed to miss obvious flags for fraud  incorrect tax documents names and addresses that didnt match on applications identities that may have been stolen and profit margins that didnt make sense Internally its leaders appeared to dismiss the warning signs too Explaining its approach a risk manager at Kabbage acknowledged in a separate exchange obtained by Congress that they took a more lax view on PPP lending because the risk here is not ours  it is SBAs sic risk  Advertisement  Another Kabbage policy official put it more bluntly over email in September 2020 using a profanity to blast the SBAs rules that created the fraud  For Kabbage the consequences became apparent in October 2020 after American Express acquired much of the company leaving a portion of its remaining PPP loan portfolio to a new entity called KServicing That company filed for bankruptcy two years later as agents for KServicing said its outstanding PPP loans  roughly 13 billion  had become overburdened by ongoing disputes and open investigations  KServicing did not immediately respond to a request for comment It said in its October bankruptcy filing that it has successfully serviced approximately 80 percent of its PPP loans It added that it vigorously disputed allegations of fraud citing probes by the Justice Department and the work of the Houses select committee  PPP did not just provide financial support to businesses facing a sudden drop in customers as the pandemic forced people to stay home The law setting the program up also allowed major banks and other firms to collect fees based on the sizes of the loans they processed Lenders then paid some of those fees to fintech companies which helped recruit applicants and vet them for potential trouble  In August 2021 researchers at the University of Texas at Austin painted a staggering picture of those earnings They estimated that PPP appeared to generate about 38 billion in fees for lenders about 86 billion of which ultimately went to fintech companies The numbers led the reports authors to conclude that the pandemic program had the potential to be a profitable business for its participants  Before the pandemic the fintech company Womply had supplied other businesses with marketing software Then arrived PPP which helped spur the company to put together what it branded as a fast lane service in February 2021  a way to market underwrite and vet PPP applications on behalf of major lenders  The endeavor would prove profitable for Womply which over the life of the program earned more than 2 billion in fees lawmakers found But officials at one lender that worked with Womply  in conversations with congressional investigators detailed in the report  said it had earned that money even as it ignored rampant fraud  Advertisement  That lender a Floridabased company called Benworth later indicated in an email that Womply had placed our company in a very bad predicament due to the high likelihood of fraud in its referred loans Citing significant glitches in its systems to evaluate loans another described Womplys fraudprevention efforts as put together with duct tape and gum according to an email cited in the report  The report alleges that Womply itself may have received federal funds improperly Congressional investigators said the company in 2020 and 2021 obtained about 7 million in PPP aid This September however the SBA determined Womply was ineligible to receive the aid  after the company requested to have its loans forgiven  Womplys chief executive Toby Scammell signed key loan documents seeking the governments permission to waive its outstanding debts according to the panel Scammell who previously pleaded guilty in 2014 to federal insider trading charges ran his businesss stimulus fraud prevention efforts investigators alleged  The lawmakers report contends that Scammell later resisted providing key documents to the SBA and its inspector general in the course of their fraud investigations Congressional aides also alleged that Womply transferred millions of PPP applicants tax and banking information to a new company Solo Global for unclear purposes  Solo Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment  For taxpayers the risk that even larger sums of money may be lost to fraud remains great  Under PPP Congress allowed the SBA to forgive the loans of eligible borrowers provided they followed the rules particularly by maintaining their payrolls Lawmakers wanted to ensure the money could keep Americans employed  while sparing hardhit small employers from debts that they might struggle later to repay  By October 93 percent of PPP recipients had some or all of their balances forgiven according to the SBAs data But the high degree of forgiveness  and the lack of internal oversight  prompted the agencys inspector general to warn in March that the government probably was forgiving PPP loans for potentially fraudulent and ineligible applicants  Its pretty clear there are a lot of suspicious loans being forgiven said Sam Kruger an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business who has studied the role of fintechs in pandemic lending  The losses also have added to pressure on the Justice Department which tapped Kevin Chambers this year to oversee the governments work to find and prosecute pandemicrelated crimes This spring federal prosecutors said they had brought charges and secured convictions involving more than 8 billion in misused covid funds a significant portion of which includes PPP and other aid administered by the SBA  On Thursday Clyburn and his aides called on federal watchdogs to conduct further investigation into these companies and pursue all appropriate remedies That could include Blueacorn a firm founded by Nathan Reis Hockridge and other entrepreneurs in 2020 to facilitate PPP loans They advertised free money and loan approvals in less than 30 seconds according to their marketing materials drawing a flood of applicants Reis did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Over the life of the loan program the company would process roughly 125 billion in PPP loans a level of involvement in 2021 greater than even the giant multinational bank JPMorgan Chase the report found Blueacorn ultimately would reap more than 1 billion in taxpayerfunded fees according to congressional investigators who said the company invested few of those dollars into oversight while enabling potentially widespread abuse  Advertisement  Working on behalf of its lending partners Blueacorn was supposed to oversee fraud and identity verification and other borrower support But company workers and contractors would later tell congressional investigators that they were illequipped for the task One witness claimed they submitted 300 PPP loans to the SBA before they even received training  The more you submit the more we get paid one worker said they were told by Blueacorn management  In doing so Blueacorn often prioritized the largest applicants seemingly hoping to extract the most in taxpayerfunded fees the report alleged In a Slack message obtained by the committee and cited in the document Hockridge at one point called loan reviewers attention to a fire  a 19 million loan that had been in the underwriting process for five days  I dont need to tell you how much Blueacorn makes off of that loan alone she wrote  Most of the fraud reviews ultimately fell to outside firms the report found including littleknown enterprises such as Elev8 Advisors The company an Arizonabased firm led by Adam and Kristen Spencer hired family members and friends with seemingly no connection to the financial sector and with no apparent experience in financial crime compliance fraud prevention or underwriting according to the probe  In an unsigned statement the company accused the House subcommittee of engaging in unfair and misleading tactics promising a more fulsome rebuttal to come  This report represents an unfortunate politicization of an important function of our government the statement said Congress responsibilities to the constituents they were elected to represent does not include engineering misleading and disparaging headlines for political gains  The statement added that Elev8 Advisors did not engage in any selfdealing and their own loans were completely appropriate and would pass muster in any objective review  The congressional report also alleged the Blueacorn founders Reis and Hockridge personally obtained about 300000 in PPP loans in ways that raised congressional investigators suspicions In one application for example Reis indicated he was an African American veteran contradicting information he submitted in the context of other PPP requests The report claims the duo lived lavishly as a result of their enterprise pointing to a video that showed Reis showing off large amounts of cash in a bar  GiftOutline Gift Article', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

staggering sums  Fintech companies including Blueacorn Womply and Kabbage were supposed to serve as middlemen  helping applicants complete paperwork and processing their requests for aid on behalf of banks and other large financial institutions In some cases though the digital firms instead became vectors for the worst waste fraud and abuse according to congressional investigators led by Rep James E Clyburn DSC the panels chairman  At Blueacorn for example loan reviewers tied to the company told the select committee they were pressured to push through PPP applications even if they seemed suspicious The company was especially interested in processing highdollar applications the report stated even creating a special internal VIPPP label to ensure the biggest borrowers  which carried the promise of great fees  could receive expedited treatment  The approach may have cost the government though House investigators could not compute a final sum It also came at the expense of smaller

disburse billions of Paycheck Protection Program dollars to struggling small businesses efficiently and expeditiously refused to take adequate steps to detect and prevent fraud despite their clear responsibility to safeguard taxpayer funds Clyburn said in a statement The allegations underscore the challenge that the US government faced amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression Totaling more than 5 trillion the countrys generous covid aid helped rescue millions of families workers and businesses from financial ruin even as it emerged as a tempting target for grift large and small The Post has found in its yearlong investigation the Covid Money Trail The losses have been especially stark at the SBA an agency tasked at the height of the pandemic to administer about 1 trillion in loans and grants As it rescued businesses the agency systematically failed to take proper care of its funds opening the door for criminals around the world to use stolen or false information to obtain limited pandemic aid Repeatedly the SBAs inspector general Hannibal Mike Ware has joined other federal watchdogs in needling the agency for its poor oversight In one early estimate Ware said there could be more than 4 billion in PPPrelated fraud adding the losses are likely to grow as scrutiny of the program continues Yet fintech companies presented a special challenge to PPP The firms were seen as critical in expanding access to capital particularly for smaller borrowers which could not obtain easy help during the pandemic from larger traditional lenders such as banks But some fintech startups had few if any preexisting relationships with needy businesses And in their haste to come online the companies may not have been as diligent in scrutinizing PPP applications experts later discovered The involvement of fintech lenders in the paycheck was definitely a doubleedged sword said Nick Schwellenbach a senior investigator at the Project On Government Oversight a watchdog group A lot of fintechs but not all really exercised insufficient due diligence in vetting loan applicants and as a result are disproportionately represented in the loans that have been deemed fraudulent or potentially fraudulent  Congressional investigators last year came to identify six firms in particular  Blueacorn BlueVine Cross River Bank Celtic Bank Kabbage and Womply  that they believed were associated with potentially fraudulent loans Their report released Thursday issued after the committee requested an intricate series of records from these and other companies shed new light on what Clyburn described as troubling business practices that have cost the government immensely  At Kabbage a fintech firm later acquired by American Express the companys own workers repeatedly shared concerns in private about fraud risks In the earliest days of the pandemic loan program an unnamed employee remarked to their supervisor in July 2020  according to internal chat records later obtained by the House committee  their fear that the level of fraud were reviewing is wildly underestimated  Kabbage like many fintech companies sought to streamline the process for small businesses to obtain PPP loans It pitched potential customers on the premise that it had helped a wide array of firms  restaurants retailers shrimp boat operators and beekeepers to name a few  obtain aid through the program even when big banks had stopped accepting new applicants The company in 2020 said its efforts alone had helped save about 945000 jobs  But the committee said that senior officials at Kabbage seemed to miss obvious flags for fraud  incorrect tax documents names and addresses that didnt match on applications identities that may have been stolen and profit margins that didnt make sense Internally its leaders appeared to dismiss the warning signs too Explaining its approach a risk manager at Kabbage acknowledged in a separate exchange obtained by Congress that they took a more lax view on PPP lending because the risk here is not ours  it is SBAs sic risk  Advertisement  Another Kabbage policy official put it more bluntly over email in September 2020 using a profanity to blast the SBAs rules that created the fraud  For Kabbage the consequences became apparent in October 2020 after American Express acquired much of the company leaving a portion of its remaining PPP loan portfolio to a new entity called KServicing That company filed for bankruptcy two years later as agents for KServicing said its outstanding PPP loans  roughly 13 billion  had become overburdened by ongoing disputes and open investigations  KServicing did not immediately respond to a request for comment It said in its October bankruptcy filing that it has successfully serviced approximately 80 percent of its PPP loans It added that it vigorously disputed allegations of fraud citing probes by the Justice Department and the work of the Houses select committee  PPP did not just provide financial support to businesses facing a sudden drop in customers as the pandemic forced people to stay home The law setting the program up also allowed major banks and other firms to collect fees based on the sizes of the loans they processed Lenders then paid some of those fees to fintech companies which helped recruit applicants and vet them for potential trouble  In August 2021 researchers at the University of Texas at Austin painted a staggering picture of those earnings They estimated that PPP appeared to generate about 38 billion in fees for lenders about 86 billion of which ultimately went to fintech companies The numbers led the reports authors to conclude that the pandemic program had the potential to be a profitable business for its participants  Before the pandemic the fintech company Womply had supplied other businesses with marketing software Then arrived PPP which helped spur the company to put together what it branded as a fast lane service in February 2021  a way to market underwrite and vet PPP applications on behalf of major lenders  The endeavor would prove profitable for Womply which over the life of the program earned more than 2 billion in fees lawmakers found But officials at one lender that worked with Womply  in conversations with congressional investigators detailed in the report  said it had earned that money even as it ignored rampant fraud  Advertisement  That lender a Floridabased company called Benworth later indicated in an email that Womply had placed our company in a very bad predicament due to the high likelihood of fraud in its referred loans Citing significant glitches in its systems to evaluate loans another described Womplys fraudprevention efforts as put together with duct tape and gum according to an email cited in the report  The report alleges that Womply itself may have received federal funds improperly Congressional investigators said the company in 2020 and 2021 obtained about 7 million in PPP aid This September however the SBA determined Womply was ineligible to receive the aid  after the company requested to have its loans forgiven  Womplys chief executive Toby Scammell signed key loan documents seeking the governments permission to waive its outstanding debts according to the panel Scammell who previously pleaded guilty in 2014 to federal insider trading charges ran his businesss stimulus fraud prevention efforts investigators alleged  The lawmakers report contends that Scammell later resisted providing key documents to the SBA and its inspector general in the course of their fraud investigations Congressional aides also alleged that Womply transferred millions of PPP applicants tax and banking information to a new company Solo Global for unclear purposes  Solo Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment  For taxpayers the risk that even larger sums of money may be lost to fraud remains great  Under PPP Congress allowed the SBA to forgive the loans of eligible borrowers provided they followed the rules particularly by maintaining their payrolls Lawmakers wanted to ensure the money could keep Americans employed  while sparing hardhit small employers from debts that they might struggle later to repay  By October 93 percent of PPP recipients had some or all of their balances forgiven according to the SBAs data But the high degree of forgiveness  and the lack of internal oversight  prompted the agencys inspector general to warn in March that the government probably was forgiving PPP loans for potentially fraudulent and ineligible applicants  Its pretty clear there are a lot of suspicious loans being forgiven said Sam Kruger an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business who has studied the role of fintechs in pandemic lending  The losses also have added to pressure on the Justice Department which tapped Kevin Chambers this year to oversee the governments work to find and prosecute pandemicrelated crimes This spring federal prosecutors said they had brought charges and secured convictions involving more than 8 billion in misused covid funds a significant portion of which includes PPP and other aid administered by the SBA  On Thursday Clyburn and his aides called on federal watchdogs to conduct further investigation into these companies and pursue all appropriate remedies That could include Blueacorn a firm founded by Nathan Reis Hockridge and other entrepreneurs in 2020 to facilitate PPP loans They advertised free money and loan approvals in less than 30 seconds according to their marketing materials drawing a flood of applicants Reis did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Over the life of the loan program the company would process roughly 125 billion in PPP loans a level of involvement in 2021 greater than even the giant multinational bank JPMorgan Chase the report found Blueacorn ultimately would reap more than 1 billion in taxpayerfunded fees according to congressional investigators who said the company invested few of those dollars into oversight while enabling potentially widespread abuse  Advertisement  Working on behalf of its lending partners Blueacorn was supposed to oversee fraud and identity verification and other borrower support But company workers and contractors would later tell congressional investigators that they were illequipped for the task One witness claimed they submitted 300 PPP loans to the SBA before they even received training  The more you submit the more we get paid one worker said they were told by Blueacorn management  In doing so Blueacorn often prioritized the largest applicants seemingly hoping to extract the most in taxpayerfunded fees the report alleged In a Slack message obtained by the committee and cited in the document Hockridge at one point called loan reviewers attention to a fire  a 19 million loan that had been in the underwriting process for five days  I dont need to tell you how much Blueacorn makes off of that loan alone she wrote  Most of the fraud reviews ultimately fell to outside firms the report found including littleknown enterprises such as Elev8 Advisors The company an Arizonabased firm led by Adam and Kristen Spencer hired family members and friends with seemingly no connection to the financial sector and with no apparent experience in financial crime compliance fraud prevention or underwriting according to the probe  In an unsigned statement the company accused the House subcommittee of engaging in unfair and misleading tactics promising a more fulsome rebuttal to come  This report represents an unfortunate politicization of an important function of our government the statement said Congress responsibilities to the constituents they were elected to represent does not include engineering misleading and disparaging headlines for political gains  The statement added that Elev8 Advisors did not engage in any selfdealing and their own loans were completely appropriate and would pass muster in any objective review  The congressional report also alleged the Blueacorn founders Reis and Hockridge personally obtained about 300000 in PPP loans in ways that raised congressional investigators suspicions In one application for example Reis indicated he was an African American veteran contradicting information he submitted in the context of other PPP requests The report claims the duo lived lavishly as a result of their enterprise pointing to a video that showed Reis showing off large amounts of cash in a bar  GiftOutline Gift Article', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

       " {'guid': 12855, 'text_a': 'Conservative states are looking to force a series of quick decisions on Title 42 teeing up litigation that if successful could leave in place for more than a year the policy that allows the country to turn away asylumseekers  A group of nearly 20 GOPled states are moving to intervene in a case hoping to challenge a decision from a federal judge who struck down Title 42 after determining the government failed to consider less drastic measures when implementing a major shift in immigration policy amid the pandemic  The states effort to angle their way into the suit is accompanied by a request to halt the lifting of Title 42 and a pledge to appeal to the Supreme Court as the policy is set to terminate just days before Christmas  The stakes in these cases over the next few weeks are enormous and will determine whether Title 42 remains in place for months and possibly more than a year said Lee Gelernt a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU and the lead counsel in the Title 42 litigation that resulted in the recent court decision blocking it  Immigration advocates have been pushing for an end to Title 42 since it was first rolled out by the Trump administration The Trump administration used Title 42 to expel asylumseekers from numerous countries into Mexico on public health grounds during the COVID19 pandemic  But its been further embraced by the administration of President Biden which recently moved to expand the policy to migrants from Venezuela  The Department of Homeland Security DHS now finds itself in the midst of competing Title 42 lawsuits as it seeks a way forward  An original lawsuit from states led by Louisiana challenged an April decision from the Biden administration to lift Title 42 That suit led to an injunction that kept the policy in place  A countersuit from the ACLU then toppled the policy with US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ruling Title 42s rollout didnt meet requirements for policy making  DHS is now appealing both rulings  a move in line with a Biden administration that has waffled on how to deal with Title 42 and criticism from the left and right on its border policies  Advocates on the left have criticized the decision to challenge Sullivans ruling arguing it gave the administration political cover to scrap what they see as a cruel policy that contravenes asylum law and turns away those in need of protection  Once the DC District Court came out saying they needed to end Title 42 I thought they were going to point to that court order to appease the political left crowd Were going to do this because we have to and you can be happy were getting rid of Title 42 which you wanted to do from Day One while being able to say to moderates We didnt want to do it but we had to do it said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández an immigration law expert and professor at Ohio State University  Appealing it I dont know what political benefit they get he added  The political right is also criticizing the Biden administration  GOP states have accused the Biden administration of strategic surrender in the case pointing to an agreement with the ACLU to delay the termination of Title 42 until Dec 21 to give DHS time to prepare They are irritated that the Biden administration has not sought a longterm stay of Sullivans ruling while they appeal  They go on to accuse DHS of exploiting calculated surrender to eliminate unwanted rules  The case is now before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where all parties are asking for a ruling by Friday  If the battle escalates to the Supreme Court and it grants the states request Title 42 could remain in place for months while the lower court litigation continues  DHS notified the courts that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC plans to issue new rulemaking on Title 42 something it hopes will nullify the need for litigation in the cases from both the ACLU and Louisiana  But critics see the action of appealing both rulings  one keeping Title 42 in place the other terminating it  as a protection of executive power from an administration that wants the ability to use the policy when it suits its needs  Its a mess its a litigation mess and DHS really does find itself in a perplexing situation said García Hernández  But it makes more sense he said when you think of the Biden administration as invested in the power of the presidency Court wins in the cases would protect the administrations ability both to roll out and unwind the policy without going through the rulemaking process dictated by the Administrative Procedures Act  They want to be able to turn the switch on and off and they dont want anyone else to be telling them that García Hernández said whether it be the courts or the states  The effort to protect the policy comes as the administration faces a steady wave of migration from the south  one that has become a constant feature of attacks from a GOP that claims the border is in crisis  The administration recognizes that Title 42 is no longer justified by public health but is unfortunately still defending CDCs actions so it potentially can invoke Title 42 in the future Gelernt said  The competing litigation stances come as the administration is trying to thread a bunch of legal and political needles he said  Theres no doubt that the administration is allowing politics to interfere with restoring the asylum system the Trump administration decimated Gelernt added  In Congress lawmakers who have pushed for an end to Title 42 have become exasperated by the litigation from an agency that says it wants to end the policy but needs time to prepare for its lifting  Theyve been preparing for some time I think thats my frustration is that weve known about the end but it doesnt sound like theyre ready yet I mean this has been happening for months now Even though they were in court they should have been getting ready Thats my concern Rep Nanette Diaz Barragán DCalif said Tuesday  On the same day another group of lawmakers including two conservative Democrats wrote to Biden urging him to do everything within your power to extend the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDCs Title 42 order beyond the looming December 21st deadline until Congress can act  For its part DHS is fighting the states sprint to intervene before Title 42s lifting arguing they lack standing to join the case  But the department also took a jab at their effort to join a case just days before the policy is set to end  The governments decision not to seek a stay pending appeal does not justify states eleventhhour effort to intervene the government wrote in its brief It should have been obvious  for months that the government might not seek a stay given

said Friday  The migrants would be allowed to come and go while staying on the ship the source said  Preliminary estimates show the plan will be cheaper than erecting another tent city similar to the one the city plans to open in the Bronx at the Orchard Beach parking lot the source said  The tent city now under construction is expected to cost 15 million a month to operate The Post exclusively reported last week  In addition to the Norwegian Cruise Line deal the source said City Hall was negotiating the possible use of another ship owned by the Estonian company Tallink which was hired by the Estonian government to house Ukrainian refugees who fled their country following Russias invasion  About 15500 migrants have flooded into the Big Apple since May amid a surge tied to President

her to avoid what would almost certainly have been a difficult primary fight forcing Democrats to decide instead whether to field a candidate in a threeway race that could give Republicans an edge Still the Arizona senator casts herself as not a spoiler but a trailblazer  a politician who is actually responding to voters very real fatigue with partisanship and providing as she put it a place of

reporters following Senate passage of the Respect for Marriage Act at the Capitol in Washington Nov 29 2022  Voices that dont feel that they fit in one party or another are still valuable voices says Clarine Nardi Riddle former chief of staff for Sen Joe Lieberman the onetime Democratic vice presidential nominee who lost his Connecticut primary in 2006 and went on to win reelection as an independent Independent voices can help with problemsolving They can bring different perspectives  and consensus perspectives Ms Riddle adds  Democratic frustration  Many Democrats including in Arizona see consensus as a euphemism for selling out They are frustrated that at a time when their party held the presidency and controlled both chambers of Congress one enigmatic senator from Arizona was able to sabotage key provisions they believed would help support working families and shore up voting rights They accuse her of protecting wealthy investors while torpedoing universal child care one group the Progressive Change Campaign Committee mocked her as leaving the Democratic Party to spend more time with her Wall Street family  Some are also furious that she  together with West Virginia Sen Joe Manchin  refused to end the filibuster which effectively allowed the GOP to hold the partys agenda hostage In a Senate divided 5050 over the past two years the filibuster meant Democrats needed the support of 10 GOP senators to advance most legislation rather than being able to use Vice President Kamala Harris tiebreaking vote to pass bills with a simple majority  Supporters counter that the main reason Senator Sinema was able to get elected as a Democrat in the first place is that she already had a track record of working across the aisle After an unsuccessful first year as a legislator in Arizonas Statehouse she changed tack as she explained in her 2009 book Unite and Conquer  Id spent all my time being a crusader for justice a patron saint for lost causes and Id missed out on the opportunity to form meaningful relationships with fellow members in the legislature lobbyists and other state actors she wrote I hadnt gotten any of my great policy ideas enacted into law and Id seen lots of stuff I didnt like become law  She went on to form broad coalitions to defeat a samesex marriage ban by engaging not only LGBTQ activists but also teachers and older unmarried couples whose domestic partners stood to lose their benefits She also got a law passed to prevent mothers from being kicked out of public areas for breastfeeding by framing it around motherhood rather than womens rights which engaged more conservative women who lobbied their representatives  The Arizona senator has always done a good job of reading the room says independent pollster Mike Noble Democrats couldnt win statewide in Arizona for the life of them until Sinema came along and said Hey this is how you win  Since then however Democrat Mark Kelly has won election to the Senate twice  once in a special election and again this fall by a relatively comfortable 5 percentage points  Mark Kelly just proved that you can run as a Democrat and win says Ms Haworth Senator Sinemas former campaign communications director You dont have to be some fake independent  Senator Kelly is also far more popular enjoying 89 favorability among Democrats  nearly triple Senator Sinemas rate and he polls 8 points higher than her among independents at 50  A growing number of independent voters  Still the independent voter trend is real Thom Reilly codirector of Arizona State Universitys Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy and coauthor of the recently released book The Independent Voter says Senator Sinema is reflecting the views of a lot of Arizonans as well as a national trend of voters leaving the twoparty system Some 42 of Americans now identify as independents giving them a doubledigit edge over Democrats and Republicans according to Gallup polling earlier this year  Sinema is responding to a large number of individuals that are increasingly frustrated with the parties Professor Reilly says  In the Senate Ms Sinema joins Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine both of whom are independents but caucus with Democrats One of the more elusive members Senator Sinema rarely attended Democratic caucus meetings even as a member of the party so its unlikely she will now But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said she would retain her committee assignments  Ms Riddle Senator Liebermans former chief of staff who is now chair of government affairs and strategic counsel practice at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP says Senator Sinemas new affiliation could help her former party bring others under their umbrella  She has the ability to help broaden the party says Ms Riddle a cofounder of No Labels an advocacy group that encourages bipartisan cooperation  In an oped for The Arizona Republic explaining her decision Senator Sinema implied her track record of bipartisan legislation shows she prioritizes problemsolving more than many of her colleagues in Washington  When politicians are more focused on denying the

seen its share of mavericks over the years most of whom were content to buck their party from within One of the most prominent was the late Sen John McCain The Arizona Republican challenged his own partys orthodoxy on everything from immigration to campaign finance reform Senator Sinema has called him a personal hero  But independents have been relatively rare in the Senate with Ms Sinema becoming just the 14th in history  In the 1950s liberal Republican Wayne Morse fell out of favor with the GOP and declared himself an independent pulling his chair into the center aisle of the Senate to make a point He later became a Democrat but retained an independent streak he was one of only two senators to oppose the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which gave the president authority for escalating US military involvement in Vietnam  Half a century later Jim Jeffords of Vermont upended the chamber when  frustrated with President George W Bush who took office in 2001 after a disputed election that ended with Supreme Court intervention  he left the GOP to become an independent and caucus with Democrats His move gave Democrats the majority overnight and all the newly appointed Republican committee chairs had to step down  It was like an earthquake recalls former Senate historian Donald Ritchie People were very upset  But Democrats would have their own challenges a few years later when Senator Lieberman got reelected as an independent Though he caucused with Democrats he now represented a broader cross section of voters and leveraged his status to extract concessions  Ross Baker a Rutgers political scientist who spent time as a scholarinresidence in Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reids office said the Connecticut senator was always a pain in the neck for Democratic leadership  Placating Joe Lieberman to pick up a vote was a very painful thing for Reid to have to do he says recalling in particular protracted negotiations over the Affordable Care Act with the senator from Connecticut home to large health insurance companies  Senator Sinemas legacy as an independent will be up to her says Professor Baker  She can basically support Democratic positions on most major

equal  A new study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open analyzed firearm deaths over the past three decades  a total of more than 1 million lives lost since 1990 The researchers found that firearm mortality rates increased for most demographic groups in recent years  especially during the pandemic  and vast disparities persisted  While recent data shows some familiar patterns the sheer scale of the issue brings the United States to a new moment in the history of firearm fatalities said Dr Eric Fleegler a pediatric emergency physician and researcher with Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School and coauthor of the study  At this moment in time we have seen a dramatic increase that is really unparalleled he said During the time of the Covid pandemic going from 2019 up to 2021 weve seen over a 25 increase in fatalities in two years alone That has never happened  Overall men are significantly more at risk Nearly 86 of all firearm deaths since 1990 have been among men according to the study which used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The researchers found that firearm homicides were highest among Black men and firearm suicide rates were highest among senior White men  Rates of firearm homicide for both men and women nearly doubled between 2014 and 2021 but men were still more than five times more likely to die than women Rates of firearm suicide were also seven times higher among men than women in 2021 despite increasing suicide rates among women over time  The racial disparities are even starker The homicide rate among young Black men  142 homicide deaths for every 100000 Black men ages 20 to 24  was nearly 10 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in the US in 2021  Homicide rates among Black and Hispanic men were highest in the 20 to 24 age group But for White men the rate was highest in the 30 to 34 age group When comparing these groups the homicide rate was nearly four times higher among young Hispanic men compared with White men and the homicide rate among young Black men was a staggering 22 times higher than among White men  When we think about bad disparities were often thinking about a 20 increase or a 50 increase With infant mortality in the United States when you look at Black infants versus White infants theres over a twofold difference in mortality rate And that is a huge number to think about Fleegler said And here were talking over 20fold These are orders of magnitude differences that are just worsening And they demand that type of attention  Video Ad Feedback Two doctors say stop blaming mental health for mass shootings 0515  Source   A countylevel analysis showed that firearm mortality shifted from the West to the South over time as firearm homicide rates remained concentrated and growing in the South and firearm suicide rates spread more evenly across the country  Urban areas had a higher burden of firearm mortality than rural areas too  There are two key factors driving community gun violence says Jonathan Jay an assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health disadvantage at the neighborhood level and exposure to gun violence at the individual level  Gun violence is most likely in spaces that show signs of physical disinvestment Sometimes that looks like unkempt vacant lots or abandoned houses that are boarded up maybe a high density of liquor stores and a low density of healthy food options he said  For Jay who received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the racial disparities in gun injuries among US youth its not surprising that patterns in firearm fatality rates only got worse  because the pandemic only exacerbated existing disparities  It makes sense that the worst early impacts would be in neighborhoods that faced the highest disadvantage and impacts of segregation before the pandemic he said Some people have talked about it like a mystery as to why gun violence would stay high even as things change in the pandemic I think one possible explanation is just that things  social conditions  havent changed that much  But also the pandemic exposed people to lots of things that made them feel unsafe and may have made individuals more likely to feel like they needed to carry a weapon for protection he said  Mental health challenges grew throughout the pandemic and violence increased but a separate analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that guns made those things significantly more deadly Between 2019 and 2021 all of the increase in suicides and most of the increase in homicides was due to guns The gun suicide rate increased 10 while the nongun suicide rate decreased by 8 and the gun homicide rate increased 45 while the nongun homicide rate increased only 6  What weve seen is that the economic and social stressors during Covid have exacerbated health disparities across the spectrum said Ari Davis a policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Gun Violence Solutions  The same same stressors  social isolation cutting social services and support  are risk factors for violence I think all those things contributed to a rise across the board but disproportionately burdening those who are most vulnerable  The research published in Tuesday confirmed much of what we already know researchers from the University of Michigan wrote in a related editorial  theres a broad gender difference an urbanrural divide and racial disparities in firearm mortality rates in the US  This burden is not distributed equally and recent increases in firearm mortality rates are most pronounced among the demographic groups and regions that were already among the most affected they wrote  But the analysis helps

Salame gave 25 million to Republicans The Justice Department is now alleging that BankmanFried and coconspirators made illegal campaign donations worth tens of millions of dollars  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The federal government is alleging serious violations of campaign finance law which could bring substantial jail sentences of their own First theyre claiming that BankmanFried has been in violation of the straw donor ban making donations in the names of other persons The documents also allege that because BankmanFried was using FTX funds to make personal donations he also violated the ban on corporate contributions Campaign finance law prohibits campaigns from taking money directly from corporations  Advertisement  Advertisement  The first part is bad news for BankmanFried Violations of the straw donor lawwhich is one of the most serious campaign finance violationsare what landed notorious fraudsters Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman as well as archright commentator and conspiracy theorist Dinesh DSouza in the clink The second part is bad news for Democrats  The Justice Department is now alleging that BankmanFried and coconspirators made illegal campaign donations worth tens of millions of dollars  Charging documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission allege that BankmanFried improperly diverted customer assets to his privatelyheld crypto hedge fund Alameda Research LLC Alameda and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments lavish real estate purchases and large political donations In plainer English BankmanFried is being charged with stealing customer funds from FTX and using that boosted corporate money to donate to politicians of his choice And while the multimilliondollar contributions via his super PAC Protect Our Future grabbed most of the headlines during election season with their eyepopping quantities BankmanFrieds personal giving also looks to be in the crosshairs of the federal governments case  Advertisement  Advertisement  The indictment is worded broadly enough that it could cover contributions SBF made in his own name using FTX funds and contributions that other people or entities made in their names but using SBF or FTX funds said Brendan Fischer deputy executive director at Documented an investigative watchdog group  Advertisement  Advertisement  That personal giving was showered on Democrats all over Washington including and especially Democrats new leadership class For instance BankmanFried gave the maximum possible amount to new top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries as did his brother Gabe BankmanFried Sam BankmanFried also maxed out to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Sean Patrick Maloney and Sen Kirsten Gillibrand and donated to her political action committee He donated to Rep Ritchie Torres too Thats just in New York He also maxed out to incoming House Democratic Caucus chair Pete Aguilar of California newly the third most powerful Dem in the House  Advertisement  Advertisement  He gave too to the consequential campaign arm PACs on both the House and Senate side for Democrats including 5000 to Team Blue PAC the political action committee founded by Jeffries FEC filings show three donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee House Democrats most important campaign arm totaling 250000 He gave repeatedly to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee the Senate side equivalent and 1 million to Senate Majority PAC the adjoining super PAC BankmanFrieds PAC Protect Our Future gave 6 million to Democrats House Majority PAC as well To be clear Republicans also got in on the action here with the National Republican Campaign Committee Susan Collins and other prominent GOPers also on the take from BankmanFried  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Did all of that money come from FTX customer accounts Well we dont know yet and thats the problem Its going to be a bear for prosecutors to figure that out said Fischer But what theyre saying is that a portion of the contributions were made using customer funds  Worse still those donations could be requisitioned in FTXs bankruptcy proceedings which are ongoing As Bloomberg recently reported At least 73 million of political donations tied to Sam BankmanFrieds FTX may be at risk of being clawed back That figure seems to include all of his personal giving along with what came from his super PAC as well as contributions from his top lieutenants to Republicans more on that in a moment  Advertisement  Advertisement  Politicians should be setting aside money with the expectation that donations from Sam BankmanFried will be clawed back in bankruptcy court  Some Democrats have already realized the liability that these donations present and have started a giving spree of their own Sen Debbie Stabenow a Michigan Democrat who received all told 26600 from BankmanFried said she plans to donate the money to a local charity Congressmanelect Maxwell Frost weeks away from officially being sworn in as the youngest member of the House just announced that he would also be donating the BankmanFried money he received to charity Many of the aforementioned Dems including Jeffries Aguilar Gillibrand and Torres have donated or said they intend to do so too  Advertisement  But not all Democrats are whistling the same tune In a recent interview Rep Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts refused the idea of turning over the money he got from BankmanFried Auchincloss was 1 of 8 members of Congress to sign a letter in March calling for the SEC to back off its investigation into crypto firms including FTX Im not going to send money to a guy sitting in a Bahamian jail he said in the recent interview That money is out the door  Advertisement  Hes right that much of the money BankmanFried gave to politicians has already been spent  Many Democrats are now stuck between some ugly options Give up the equivalent amount of money via charitable donation wait for it to be clawed back in bankruptcy court or wait for it to be identified as stolen by the federal government And while paying back several thousand dollars in donations is not a huge financial burden for senior Dems like Jeffries or Aguilar the much larger donations to the DCCC DSCC and other campaign arms make the whole situation much more treacherousand awkward  Giving the money away doesnt make the problems go away with it Campaign finance attorney Brett Kappel recently warned in an Associated Press report that those politicians should be setting the money aside with the expectation that it will have to be sent back in bankruptcy court The Federal Election Commission requires political campaigns and committees to return donations found to have been made illegally even if new money has to be raised to facilitate that reimbursement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  In fact its possible that the incoming DCCC and DSCC chairs yet to be chosen will have to raise money not to kick off the 2024 campaign cycle but to pay down those numbers and help get the BankmanFried donations off the books Exceedingly few Democrats have been willing to put themselves up for those two jobs for this upcoming cycle even without the BankmanFried headache they have become widely understood as the worst jobs in Washington Now they look that much worse  Are Republicans in the clear Absolutely not FTXs coCEO Ryan Salame gave 25 million to Republicans and the FTXs top brass routed money to Sen Mitch McConnell and Rep Kevin McCarthy as well as 35 million to the GOPs Senate Leadership Fund super PAC BankmanFried has claimed that he gave just as much in dark money to the GOP as he did in registered giving to Democrats The details of that dark money still havent come to light But its very likely Republicans will find themselves in a similar position Sen John Hoeven a North Dakota Republican has already announced that he gave 11600money received from BankmanFried and Salameto the Salvation Army  Advertisement  Back on the blue side of the aisle critics have rightly said that the party courted this disaster by embracing the lavish spending of an overnight billionaire Just a few weeks after Election Day the decision to accept BankmanFrieds involvement in Democratic campaigns has become a political liabilityfueling various conspiracy theoriesas well as a financial one At best it was a massive tactical gaffe  Dont forget that BankmanFried aside from his personal donations to candidates left Democrats high and dry in the general election after pledging to spend exorbitantly They got almost no advantage from his support once November rolled around The obvious move from here would be to enact higher institutional barriers for billionaire involvement and super PAC spending in the Democratic political process  Still even Democrats who have disavowed or donated the BankmanFried money still benefited from it during election season some members of the freshman class might not be in Washington without the help of his machine Its an ugly and expensive start for a new class and new

the COVID19 vaccine mandate due to religious objections are now being terminated just before they gain full access to promised military pension and retirement benefits  Other lawmakers are speaking up about this saying Congress needs to take additional action  These heroes deserve justice now that the mandate is no more The Biden administration must correct service records and not stand in the way of reenlisting any service member discharged simply for not taking the COVID vaccine House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif said in a statement  Make no mistake this is a win for our military But in 28 days the real work begins  the new House Republican majority will work to finally hold the Biden administration accountable and assist the men and women in uniform who were unfairly targeted by this Administration said McCarthy who is poised to become the next speaker of the House in January if he secures enough votes  Rep Greg Steube RFla told  Digital that he is disappointed the NDAA text doesnt provide for full reinstatement of discharged service members but the incoming House majority will right that wrong  We shouldnt underscore the significance of this win for freedom and religious liberty  but the vast majority of our military personnel have already been coerced into receiving the COVID19 vaccine or involuntarily separated said Steube Im disappointed the NDAA does not include language for a full reinstatement of these individuals into the military I can assure you in the GOP majority were going to do whats right and make sure the DoD corrects military records processes backpay reinstates full benefits and ensures a smooth reenlistment process for those servicemembers who want to reenter after being wrongfully discharged  CLICK HERE TO GET THE  APP  Rep Darrell Issa RCalif told  Digital he is dissatisfied with the House proposal to strip the military COVID19 vaccine mandate from the text of the national defense spending bill and said it must go further to stop the demoralization that US service members have endured   The repair has to be reinstating individuals who want to come back correcting their records allowing these individuals who have served honorably to be recognized that way he said  Issa said he will propose two types of legislation in the next Congress when Republicans take the majority The first will be the Religious Exemption Recognition Act which would reinstate and restore those who refused the vaccine for any number of valid reasons  Second he will establish a process to review religious accommodation cases that will be enshrined in federal statute so it is not at the whim of the commanderinchief to ignore the First Amendment', 'text_b': None, 'label': 4},\n",

within each party say theyd rather see someone new nominated in 2024  About 6 in 10 Republicans and Republicanleaning independents say they want their party to nominate someone other than former President Donald Trump in 2024 62 while a similar 59 of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents say theyd like to see someone other than President Joe Biden at the top of their ticket in the next presidential election When pressed though a majority of Republicanaligned voters who say theyd like someone other than Trump to win the nomination indicate they would ultimately vote for him if he did emerge as the nominee An even larger majority of Democraticaligned voters with a similar opposition to Biden as their partys nominee say they would vote for him in a general election if he won their partys primary  Video Ad Feedback Michael Cohen reacts to Trumps Truth Social post 0245  Source   Support for another Trump bid for the presidency among Republicanaligned voters has declined across three  polls on the topic this year In January the poll found a neareven split 50 said they hoped Trump would be the nominee and 49 wanted someone else By July 44 wanted Trump to be the partys nominee and now 38 say the same  The steepest drops in support for a Trump bid came among older Republicanaligned voters from 55 of Republicans and Republicanleaners 65 or older supporting a Trump bid in January to 37 in support of one now White voters with college degrees from 31 backing Trump in January to 16 now and those who describe themselves as very conservative from 65 behind a Trump bid then to 42 now  Among those who want someone other than Trump to be the nominee 47 have a specific alternate candidate in mind including 38 who singled out Florida Gov Ron DeSantis No other potential nominee was named by more than 1 The survey also finds DeSantis favorability among Republicans and Republicanleaning independent voters overall outpacing the former presidents ratings 74 view DeSantis favorably and 7 unfavorably while 63 have a favorable view of Trump and 28 an unfavorable one  Despite tepid support for Trump to win the nomination the survey finds the former president would likely enjoy majority backing among Republicanaligned voters in the general election if he did emerge as the partys candidate About twothirds of those who want someone else to be the nominee also say they would definitely 36 or probably 30 vote for Trump if he did become the partys nominee In total roughly 8 in 10 Republicanaligned voters either want Trump to be the nominee 38 or say they would likely vote for him if he won the partys nod41  About half of Republicanaligned voters 52 say that Trump has had a good effect on the Republican Party down from 69 who felt that way in March 2021 A third 33 say hes had a bad effect and 15 that he hasnt made much difference  Slightly increased appetite for Biden as the nominee run since the summer  The share of Democraticaligned voters who would like to see Biden as their partys nominee has rebounded somewhat from the low point it reached in s polling this summer when just 25 said they wanted Biden to be the nominee Still fewer now say that theyd like Biden to be the nominee 40 than felt that way in January 45  Compared with January theres been a steeper increase in support for nominating someone other than Biden among Democraticaligned voters of color from 43 to 53 than among White voters from 57 to 63 and among independents who lean toward the Democratic Party from 60 to 77 than selfidentified Democrats from 48 to 53 Younger Democraticaligned voters are also notably less supportive of a Bidenled presidential ticket than are older voters 74 of those younger than 35 would like to see someone else at the top of the ticket compared with just 43 of those age 65 or older  Among Democrats who say theyd like someone else as the partys nominee nearly threequarters 72 say they have no one specific in mind Among those who do name another candidate 5 mention Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg 4 California Gov Gavin Newsom 4 Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders 3 Vice President Kamala Harris and 2 Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren  Bidens favorability among his partisans outpaces favorable views of two other Democrats who are possible contenders for the presidential nomination Harris and Newsom Among Democrats and Democraticleaning independent voters 83 have a favorable view of Biden and 11 an unfavorable one Harris scores a 66 favorability rating with 14 holding an unfavorable view and Newsom a 45 favorable rating with 9 unfavorable and 46 with no opinion of him  Even those Democrats who are not fully on board with a Biden run for a second term still largely say they would back him if he did become the partys nominee Among the 59 of Democraticaligned voters who would prefer another nominee about half 51 say they would definitely vote for Biden if he became the nominee and another 28 say they would probably back him All told 86 of Democrats either support Biden for the nomination or say they would likely vote for him in the general election if he were the nominee  A narrow majority of Democraticaligned voters 53 see Biden as having had a good effect on the Democratic Party while 9 say hes had a bad effect and 38 say that he hasnt made much difference  More broadly though the poll suggests a Biden bid for a second term might begin on shaky ground Nearly twothirds of Americans say the president does not deserve reelection 62 while only 37 say he does Republicans and Republican leaners are near universal in their view that he should not be reelected 94 say he does not deserve a second term Among Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 70 say the president does deserve a second term 28 that he does not Bidens sharpest critics within the party are again the youngest members of his party Only 56 of those younger than 35 who align with the Democratic Party say Biden deserves a second term compared with 80 among those age 50 or older who are Democrats or Democraticleaners  At the same time the poll finds multiple measures of Bidens popularity improving Overall favorable views of the president stand at 42 favorable to 52 unfavorable Its a negative rating but a shift toward the positive since this summer when only 36 held a favorable view Findings from the same poll released earlier this week showed an uptick in Bidens approval rating from 41 just before the election to 46 now Beyond those two measures nearly twothirds of adults say they see Bidens views and policies as generally mainstream 63 rather than too extreme 37 about the same as in a  poll in late summer 2021  Trump has seen no such shift in his favorability rating Just 31 in the new poll rate him positively the smallest share to do so since before he was elected president while 60 hold an unfavorable view And a broad majority say they see Trumps views and policies as too extreme  68 say so including 45 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents  while only 32 see the former president as generally mainstream  This  Poll was conducted by SSRS on December 1 through 7 among

Kurdish woman Mahsa Jina Amini in September According to Iran Human Rights IHR as of early October at least 150 people had died in connection with the protests  On September 13 Mahsa Jina Amini was arrested in the Iranian capital Tehran by Irans socalled morality police who apparently found fault with the way she was wearing her headscarf She collapsed while in police custody in circumstances that remain unclear and was pronounced dead three days later at an Iranian hospital  The protests have not stopped since despite police deploying violence to quell them Videos and images of police brutality have gone viral on social media especially Instagram which is widely used in Iran The social platform was one of the last to be publicly accessible in Iran  Mobile internet disrupted for

NetBlocks a Londonbased global internet monitoring organization Irans big three mobile providers Irancell Rightel and MCI block internet traffic from the outside world from about 4 pm to midnight each

Image EPAEFE  Instagram censored  While the Iranian regime has restricted internet access some say that social media platforms themselves are also engaging in censorship Opposition activists groups and media outlets claim that Instagram has removed certain hashtags videos and posts  In a tweet the Iranianborn British actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi asked why Facebook parent company Meta which also runs Instagram had deleted so many protestrelated posts The USIranian journalist Saman Arbabi accused Meta too of having recently removed a video showing protesters wishing death on the Iranian leader On Twitter he suggested the company had more respect for dictators than protest banners and slogans He said that a post that had reportedly garnered 33 million views had also been deleted Manoto TV a station run by Iranian exiles and the documentary network 1500 Tasvir have also reported deleted posts  I have noticed and experienced this as well Michaelsen told DW He and an Iranian colleague have been looking into these developments documenting posts that are being deleted while other similar content remains accessible It is difficult to explain why Metas guidelines are at times being so drastically enforced I do not have an explanation for this but that is how it is  Meta says no restrictions in place  Asked to comment on the allegations a Meta spokesperson told DW We believe passionately in peoples right to online access including in Iran Iranians use apps like Instagram to stay close to their loved ones find information and shed light on important events  and we hope the Iranian authorities restore their access soon In the meantime our teams are following the situation closely and are focused on only removing content that breaks our rules while addressing any enforcement mistakes as quickly as possible  Meta told the German public radio station BR that the restrictions imposed on Manoto TV had been designed to curb spam and had been lifted The company

core of our mission and our daily work We give you arguments you decide what to think And so when we review the major events of the past year  which included a land war in Europe the collapse of crypto and yes The Slap  its only natural for us to reflect on the debates What can the United States do to try to end that war Is crypto a reasonable thing to invest in When is it appropriate to hit someone in the face for making a joke about your wife As 2022 nears its end we are presenting 22 of the debates that defined the year revisiting the ones you might remember and reminding you of the ones you might have tried to forget and asking the most important question of all Did you change your mind Click on the topics to read more and vote  Like them or hate them masks long ago became culture war fodder  that is the debate around wearing them was so laden with subtext that it was hardly about the value of masks at all And this year the debate dragged on After the TSA lifted its mask mandate on airplanes in April videos went viral of midflight celebrations as pilots announced that the rules had changed This was proof that Americans were ready to bare their faces and inhale Or was it Some public health advocates  and public commentators  argued that our noses and mouths should stay covered for the good of ourselves and our neighbors A late autumn surge in respiratory viruses brought the issue back But at this point in the pandemic most minds are probably made up So would all that energy be put to better use pushing for better building ventilation instead At least open windows arent fraught with symbolism  yet  Experts waxed poetic about the potential of the hybrid workplace if only every companys existing offices workflows and managerial structures were completely redesigned around it Companies trying to enforce some amount of mandatory inoffice time meanwhile gestured back to the halcyon days when merely the zip produced by passing a warm body in the hallway resulted in unparalleled creative output Yes there are real reasons to love the hybrid work model less commuting time but you still know your colleagues and reasons to hate it going to an empty office just to sit on Zoom feels like a scene from Dilbert But until every companys returntooffice plan is final and firm were going to keep the conversation going  around the water cooler or over email  Crime rates have risen in many parts of the United States over the past few years But they remain far lower than they were as recently as the 1990s One thing thats definitely spiked heated politicized polarized discussion around the issue Whats the deal with crime Has much of America descended into lawlessness thanks to softoncrime progressive prosecutors and a movement to defund the police Are liberals refusing to grapple with reality when it comes to robberies and murders Or is it essentially all in our heads really more of a story about bad vibes than bad guys Are people confusing other issues  especially homelessness  with crime In the runup to this years midterm elections crime was a top issue in races from Oklahoma to New York but ultimately it rarely proved decisive There are serious unsettled questions about how crime is measured Statistics are notoriously unreliable outdated and piecemeal And policing  and everything around it  remains as fraught as ever Lets see if the vibes improve in 2023  When President Biden announced in August that the federal government would forgive up to 20000 per borrower in student loan debt estimated to total roughly 400 billion the response was fierce Activists anxious debtors and Senator Elizabeth Warren  to name just one prominent voice  said that the package was a huge step toward fixing the problem of Americas costly higher education system Some even said Mr Bidens debt relief plan didnt go far enough Many other Americans on the other hand felt that the White Houses plan was just plain unfair They had scrimped and saved to pay for posthigh school education and now others were getting undeserved handouts And anyway would a payout do anything to solve the real issue which is that higher education in America is far too expensive In the end it wont be the court of public opinion that matters The administrations debt relief plan has been tied up in legal challenges practically since the day it was announced and its headed for the Supreme Court That means were in for at least another year of disagreement  The event that would come to be known as The Slap  the actor Will Smiths assault on the comedian Chris Rock after the latter made a joke about Mr Smiths wife Jada Pinkett Smith  was so shocking Physical assault During one of live televisions most stage managed events and touched on so many of Americas most neuralgic subjects Free speech Toxic masculinity Ableism Black manhood Black womanhood that it spawned a flurry of takes in the aftermath that few other events this year have matched Remember when Judd Apatow tweeted that Mr Smith could have killed him Remember when a spokesman for the British prime minister weighed in It seemed like every possible angle had its proponents Mr Smith was defending his wife in a way that Black women are rarely defended defending a womans honor with physical violence was an expression of toxic masculinity Will and Jada were longtime celebrities who should know by now how to take a joke no one should have to take a joke Mr Smith should be arrested for assault calls for his arrest showcased Americans carceral attitudes toward Black men In the end the fact that The Slap  a minor scuffle involving three famous people  was being mustered as evidence for so many different agendas and worldviews should perhaps be taken as a sign that the simplest take is the right one here America really likes talking about celebrities  This year the digital gold rush dried up Prospectors who had mined speculative assets weathered a series of crashes that threatened to bust their boom towns while everyone else watched Even no coiners finally had to figure out how crypto works if only to learn enough to mock its true believers One might think that after a year of crypto implosions culminating in FTXs November megacollapse to blame the Democratboosting billionaire Sam BankmanFrieds bad business practices  and maybe even criminality faith in the currencys sanctity might finally fail After all even if workplace harassment a trashtalking CEO turned fugitive or an embarrassing series of hacks didnt kill your faith in cryptos prophets surely the loss of your teachers pension fund would But cryptos not gone yet Its boosters are still boosting insisting that this shortterm dip in the market amounts to nothing more than growing pains And large firms like Fidelity and BlackRock havent given up on crypto investing either In doing so theyre transforming glimmering speculative mumbojumbo into just another line item in your friendly neighborhood investment portfolio  The Depp vs Heard trial produced so many grim details about the pairs life together that its hard to single out a defining moment Was it Mr Depps texts to a friend about wanting to have sex with Ms Heards corpse Or when he accused her of defecating in their bed It produced audio clips in which the whole country heard two Hollywood stars screaming at each other like the most toxic couple you know stumbling home after last call At first following the trial seemed tawdry like being invested in some especially prurient celebrity gossip But then something seemed to shift The internet appeared en masse to side with Captain Jack Sparrow going into mememaking overdrive with such fervor that it was almost suspicious Indeed theres evidence that bot accounts were created to retweet hashtags like AmberHeardIsALiar Then came the verdict which awarded a whopping 835 million to Mr Depp at a moment when it felt like womens rights were on the ropes Less than a month earlier a draft of the Supreme Court opinion that would eventually repeal Roe v Wade had leaked Many argued that what we were seeing unfold around Depp vs Heard was the inevitable MeToo backlash Some found this idea delightful and hoped Ms Heards ugly behavior as revealed in court might succeed in undermining the idea of believe women for good others felt that the reaction to the trial proved just how deep misogyny still runs through American culture But by the time it was over most seemed to agree that this trial wasnt just about a messy celebrity couple but something bigger  The moment that Queen Elizabeth II died in September the future of the British monarchy suddenly seemed like an open question And so did how to assess the late royals legacy To many she was an icon She ruled for 70 years presided over the transition from empire to commonwealth and served as a living link to the generation that won World War II She herself worked as a mechanic during the war She was her supporters said a steady figurehead for the ship of state during a tumultuous period and a leader of a British democracy that took decades to extract itself from a postwar malaise and emerged with diminished influence and power On the other hand She ruled for 70 years and presided over the transition from empire to commonwealth a process that was sometimes ugly Under her ceremonial gaze the fading empire brutally repressed people in its colonies  the Kenyan Mau Mau rebels and the Catholic Irish most famously  and was reticent to condemn apartheid South Africa and committed atrocities against Malayan National Liberation Army rebels Queen Elizabeth was not making governmental decisions that led to policy exactly but the legacy of her rule is still the legacy of the Britain she presided over republicans claim Under her son and successor Charles III certainly less popular than his mother questions about the monarchys future  and its past  will likely only intensify  Inflation made life expensive in 2022 and the Federal Reserve came to the rescue by raising interest rates for the first time in years But its a finicky process Raise them too little and inflation persists raise them too fast and the economy falls into a recession People will lose their jobs and be unable to buy the goods that inflation was making unaffordable anyway In a survey of Americas top academic economists nearly 70 percent said they expected a recession in 2023 The Federal Reserve is famously tightlipped about its policymaking But that didnt stop economists politicians and pundits from squabbling over what the central bank should be doing If price increases were being caused primarily by a spike in the price of oil or to use President Bidens attempt at a coinage the Putin price hike how much would raising interest rates actually help Some economists worried about a return to the dreaded stagflation of the 1970s Though Ben Bernanke a former Fed chairman himself wrote in The Times that that wasnt going to happen Other economists said it was time to cool down the economy before wages started to rise too much creating an unstoppable spiral As the year draws to a close it looks like inflation may be slowing and the Feds rate increases with it We may never know what actually was the cause  The Houses hearings into the Jan 6 riot were many things a piece of political theater a ratings and traffic boon for the political news media a second draft of history a formal investigation into the actions of Donald Trump and those around him during the days events But did they matter beyond a record for posterity In a country riven with partisan polarization and divided into information bubbles could they Judging by the reception that election denial got at the polls it seems that the American voter did consider them important None of the election deniers in states that Mr Biden won in 2020 were elected to office and no candidates that ran on election denial anywhere won their elections But Mr Trump is running again in 2024 The hearings did not end his political career any more than the riot itself did and the movement that he galvanized is still around Changing minds is different from rallying the converted Whether the hearings were truly important might not be known until the ballots are counted in two years Until then we may have to make do with halfverdicts  Two political truisms Elections are mainly about economic conditions and the presidents party is at a severe disadvantage during midterm elections So with high inflation high gas prices in particular and a possible recession on the horizon prospects for a Republican blowout seemed good But instead of a red wave that would set the stage for a Republican trifecta in two years Democrats added to their Senate majority even if they did lose the House Was the verdict of the voters motivated by Mr Bidens policy agenda and a fulfillment of his promise to restore the soul of America Or was it a vote of no confidence in the Republican Partys culture war politics continuing fidelity to the unpopular Mr Trump and antiabortion overreach Its hard to divine an answer from the inkblot test of the exit polls but Mr Biden is not a popular figure It could be that even if voters were mostly voting against Republicans and not for Democrats they were mobilized to do so by the Democrats political strategy which emphasized attacking Republicans on abortion rights and election denial as much as talking about pocketbook issues If so this could bode well for their chances of retaining the presidency when voters go to the polls in two years  Cake frosting smeared on the Mona Lisa Mashed potatoes flung at a Monet Tomato soup splashed across a van Gogh This year environmental activists all over the world made headlines with a series of shocking and somewhat bizarre attacks on famous works of art vandalizing them with what seemed to be whatever was in their refrigerators Though its worth noting that none of the paintings were actually damaged The attacks were certainly successful at getting peoples attention  newspapers across the world including this one published stories about them  though reactions were mixed Many were outraged by the defacing of these masterpieces insisting that the activists be held legally or even criminally responsible Others who were more sympathetic to the activists cause came to their defense arguing that their actions were justified given their noble intentions and the truly dire state of our planet The stunts some of which were accompanied by sitins and speeches were intended to draw international attention to the climate crisis at a moment when tamer forms of protest have not inspired collective action Which raises the question What is effective protest  In April the Tesla CEO wealthiest man on Earth and avid tweeter Elon Musk moved to purchase Twitter for 44 billion When after many months of waffling the sale finally went through in late October Mr Musk announced sweeping changes He laid off nearly half the staff and announced that he would crack down on misinformation and impose an eightdollar monthly subscription fee for verified status The world erupted into debate about the companys future  much of it taking place on Twitter itself Some mourned the imminent demise of the beloved platform worrying that Mr Musks more laissezfaire approach to content moderation would turn the site into a cesspool of misinformation and hate speech others countered that Twitter already was a cesspool of misinformation and hate speech and if Mr Musk ran the company into the ground the world would be better for it The whole ordeal has reinvigorated a longsimmering debate about the role of social media in American politics and modern life  When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided this summer that she would visit Taiwan she knew she was stirring up a geopolitical hornets nest China considers the island an integral part of its country and intends to reclaim it someday Taiwan sees itself as a democratic fortress standing up to the worlds most powerful authoritarian Ms Pelosi seems to agree with the Taiwanese Even before her plane took off commentators began weighing in The Times Opinion columnist Thomas L Friedman called it utterly reckless dangerous and irresponsible More hawkish commentators meanwhile urged her not to back down in the face of Chinese threats In an OpEd of her own in The Washington Post Ms Pelosi wrote that the visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan our democratic partner as it defends itself and its freedom In the end the speakers trip didnt lead to a war between China and the United States But it did ratchet up tensions in the Pacific with the Chinese military circling the island and issuing warnings Its pretty clear that Xi Jinpings mind didnt change  It wasnt just about Maitland Jones Jr But his story seemed to encapsulate what was on many Americans minds When The Times reported in early October that Mr Jones a chemistry professor at New York University had been fired following a petition from students complaining that his organic chemistry class was simply too hard  impossibly hard  a debate erupted across the country Is the problem students or the system The professor wasnt just speaking for himself when he said that universities coddle students instead of giving them tough love Many inside the academy and beyond feel that students these days prefer spoon feeding to long hours in the library And its not just about orgo either The same generation that cant handle hard work cant handle ideas that it finds too triggering either Or  maybe not The Jones story was also instructive about changes to American higher education how its increasing cost has led many debtladen students to feel more like customers than pupils how a system of gatekeeping is past its expiration date how students are challenging old hierarchies of power how colleges are relying on adjuncts to do more and more work  all topics worthy of serious discussion  The Supreme Courts decision in June to overturn Roe v Wade was hardly a surprise Just weeks earlier a draft of the decision was leaked to Politico Still it felt like a shock to Americans on both sides of the divide over abortion rights Even the prolife movement has to admit that the courts decision was out of step with public opinion More than 60 percent of Americans want abortion to be legal in most cases While much discussion focused on the future of reproductive health care and rights another issue quickly arose in the wake of the decision and other conservative rulings on gun control and the environment Was the Supreme Court losing its legitimacy The courts official duty is to interpret the Constitution but historically its rulings have largely been in line with popular opinion Not anymore Opinion polls showed that faith in the justices was at an alltime low Many legal scholars warned that Americas highest judicial body was undermining itself by moving too far to the right Many conservatives meanwhile argued that that bridge had already been crossed with liberal rulings  including Roe  making the court seem like a political body rather than an independent arbiter of the law Maybe the question is not if the court has lost its legitimacy but when  That the number of young people who identify as transgender is on the rise is not in dispute But what does it mean Is this a sign that more are living openly as their real selves in a more welcoming society Or a sign that the standard tumult of adolescence is being channeled in a new direction with potentially unintended consequences There are those like Erica Anderson a transgender psychologist who argue that clinicians today acting in the name of tolerance and inclusivity have become too ready to default to interventions like hormones or puberty blockers for every young person experiencing gender dysphoria without performing the comprehensive individual mental health assessments that should accompany them And then there are others  including many advocates for trans rights  who argue that the debates around trans youth are just another facet of a larger moral panic around gender and dismiss the idea that joining the ranks of one of societys most marginalized and vulnerable groups is a choice anyone would make lightly Where is all this going It would be one thing if it could remain a discussion among those who in good faith are simply seeking the best way to help young people who are indisputably in distress Unfortunately these same young people are also indisputably being used by rightwing politicians across the country as cannon fodder in the culture wars See Gov Greg Abbotts order that Texas health agencies should treat the provision of medical treatments to transgender young people as child abuse Thats a development that adds heat to the debate but not much light  Ive heard the word diversity quite a few times and I dont have a clue what it means Justice Clarence Thomas told a lawyer for the University of North Carolina in a muchquoted line from oral arguments before the Supreme Court this fall that will determine the fate of affirmative action in America All signs point to the conservative court ending the current form of racebased preference in higher education admissions many of which have been in place since the late 1960s Some are cheering the looming end of a flawed system which has succeeded in making elite campuses more racially diverse while still leaving them woefully out of touch with  and out of the reach of  most Americans Others fret that the end of racebased preferences will come long before they have succeeded in their initial goal as articulated by Lyndon Johnson in a 1965 speech at Howard University giving Black people the same chance of success in America as white people But the discussion around affirmative action has also broadened Diversity on campus What does it mean Would classbased admissions help achieve a better version of it And who does it actually serve Does it imply that minorities are instruments to improve the educational experience of the majority Is the goal to make elite campuses more diverse or to help underprivileged Americans receive the best possible education  in which case why focus on a handful of selective schools that serve a tiny percentage of the population The Supreme Court is expected to rule next summer  but its unlikely to be the last word  Golf is supposed to be boring right Maybe not The socalled gentlemans game found itself in the center of a firestorm this year with players openly sniping at one another in the press and pundits debating major ethical questions The firestorm began when plans for the LIV Golf Tour were announced this summer The new tour which kicked off with a tournament in Britain in June is to be a rival to the more established PGA and DP World Tours Some players and fans say that LIV will undermine the legacy tours and permanently alter the professional game for the worse LIVs backers say it will push needed reforms to the PGA But the biggest source of controversy LIVs primary backer is Saudi Arabia which put some 400 million into getting it off the ground And of course there was Donald Trump Several of LIVs events have been held at clubs owned by the former president Phil Mickelson a PGA champion called the Saudis scary to get involved with citing the 2018 killing of the Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi  the very reason detractors say that Saudi Arabia is trying to rehab its reputation through sports But that wasnt enough to stop Mr Mickelson from joining LIV in the hopes that it puts pressure on the PGA Now he insists that the new tour is the winning side His biggest foil is also one of the games biggest stars Tiger Woods who was reportedly offered around 700 million if he signed onto LIV has been one of its most vocal opponents saying that the flood of money is bad for competition Even if this debate may have escaped your attention its implications could be enormous for a world of sports increasingly awash in foreign cash  When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24 condemnation of President Vladimir Putin was swift and loud from across the political spectrum So was support for the government in Kyiv Outandout defenders of the Kremlin were exceedingly difficult to find in America But once Ukrainian forces drove the Russians back from Kyiv and as the war dragged on through the summer and the fall disagreements began to emerge The United States and its European allies poured weapons and aid into Ukraine but how was this going to end Some figures  including leftwing members of Congress antiintervention analysts and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  suggested that the United States should begin pushing for negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv How many more lives needed to be lost before a settlement was reached Didnt the dangers of the war spiraling out of control Mr Putin has more than once raised the threat of using nuclear weapons make peace an imperative Only diplomacy could bring the bloodshed to an end Louder though were the voices calling for Washington to continue to back Ukraine as it made gains on the battlefield The realist argument was in the words

continues and peace talks look as distant as ever  which probably means that the debates will continue  This summer the art world was set abuzz when the Colorado State Fairs annual art competition

has been around for years But tools released in 2022  with names like DALLE 2 Midjourney and Stable Diffusion  have made it easier than ever to produce visually striking images with little more than a few clicks This has made many human artists understandably nervous about their futures Why would anyone pay for art they wonder when they could just generate it themselves It has also generated a fierce debate about the ethics of AIgenerated art On the one side are people like Mr Allen who believe AI art is the way of the future As he put it Art is dead dude Its over AI won Humans lost On the other are those who believe that something that requires so little skill or effort cant truly rise to the level of art  or who say that what these apps produce essentially amounts to a hightech form

show of public defiance in years                HONG KONGBEIJING Dec 1   China is set to announce an easing of its COVID19 quarantine protocols in the coming days and a reduction in mass testing sources told  a marked shift in policy after anger over the worlds toughest curbs fuelled widespread protests  Cases nationwide remain near record highs but the changes come as some cities have been lifting their lockdowns in recent days and a top official said the ability of the virus to cause disease was weakening  Health authorities announcing the easing in their areas have not mentioned the protests  the biggest show of civil disobedience in China for years  which ranged from candlelit vigils in Beijing to street clashes with police in Guangzhou  The measures due to be unveiled include a reduction in the use of mass testing and regular nucleic acid tests as well as moves to allow positive cases and close contacts to isolate at home under certain conditions the sources familiar with the matter said  That is a far cry from earlier protocols that led to public frustrations as entire communities were locked down sometimes for weeks after even just one positive case  The frustration boiled over last week in demonstrations of public defiance unprecedented in mainland China since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012 The unrest comes as the economy is set to enter a new era of much slower growth than seen in decades  On Thursday night Shanghai train commuters reported wirelessly receiving an unsolicited document onto their phones saying that life in China would only get better if there was a full lifting of lockdown and that Xi step down  an apparently new tactic amid a heavy police presence in some cities ahead of the weekend  CHANGING RULES  Less than 24 hours after violent protests in Guangzhou on Tuesday authorities in at least seven districts of the sprawling manufacturing hub said they were lifting temporary lockdowns One district said it would allow schools restaurants and businesses including cinemas to reopen  Cities including Chongqing and Zhengzhou also announced easings  The sense of official momentum towards a landmark shift built on Thursday as Vice Premier Sun Chunlan who oversees COVID efforts told a meeting of frontline experts that the Omicron variant was weakening in its ability to cause disease allowing China to improve prevention efforts  After nearly three years fighting against the epidemic our countrys medical and healthcare system has withstood the test she said in remarks published by the official Xinhua news agency  The vaccination rate of the entire population exceeds 90 and public health awareness and quality has been improved signifciantly she said  State media reported Sun saying a day earlier that China was facing a new situation in its response to COVID and urged further optimisation of testing treatment and quarantine policies  The mention of weakening COVID pathogenicity contrasts with previous messages from a usually hawkish Sun about the deadliness of the virus  Suns earlier speech in addition to the notable easing of COVID control measures in Guangzhou yesterday sends yet another strong signal that the zeroCOVID policy will end within the next few months analysts at Nomura said in a research note  114 Pandemic prevention workers in protective suits get ready to enter an apartment building that went into lockdown as coronavirus disease COVID19 outbreaks continue in Beijing December 2 2022 Thomas Peter 1 2 3 4 5  These two events perhaps point to the beginning of the end of zeroCOVID  In the capital Beijing some communities have begun preparing for changes  One community in the east of the city held an online poll this week on the possibility of positive cases isolating at home residents said  I certainly welcome the decision by our residential community to run this vote regardless of the outcome said resident Tom Simpson managing director for China at the ChinaBritain Business Council  He said his main concern was being forced to go into a quarantine facility where conditions can be grim to say the least  Prominent nationalist commentator Hu Xijin said in a social media post on Wednesday that many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in Beijing were already quarantining at home  REOPENING NEXT YEAR  Expectations have grown around the world that China while still trying to contain infections could look to reopen its borders at some point next year once it achieves better vaccination rates among its hesitant elderly  Health experts warn of widespread illness and death if COVID is let loose before vaccination is ramped up  Chinese stocks and markets around the world dipped initially after the weekend protests in Shanghai Beijing and other cities but later recovered on hopes that public pressure could lead to a new approach by authorities  More COVID outbreaks could weigh on Chinas economic activity in the near term the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday adding it saw scope for a safe recalibration of policies that could allow economic growth to pick up in 2023  Chinas strict containment measures have dampened domestic economic activity this year and spilled over to other countries through supply chain interruptions  Following downbeat data in an official survey on Wednesday the CaixinSP Global manufacturing purchasing managers index showed factory activity shrank in November for a fourth consecutive month  While the change in tone on COVID appears a response to the public discontent with strict measures authorities are also seeking out for questioning those present at the demonstrations  China Dissent Monitor run by US governmentfunded Freedom House estimated at least 27

widespread issues involving the machines that count voters ballots  All of the countys 223 voting locations opened on time but an hour into the election voters and poll workers at some sites started reporting issues with tabulators Initially officials estimated that about 10 of polling places were experiencing problems  That estimate got raised to 20 and then 30 of the countys voting locations before officials found and fixed the issue  timing marks that had been printed on ballots  In Maricopa County printers at polling sites produce ballots on demand so that voters can vote at any location in the county rather than being assigned a polling place The formatting marks on the ballots produced by some printers werent being printed dark enough for the tabulators to read officials said  By 3 pm technological support staff had managed to resolve the problems at 17 of the roughly 60 voting locations experiencing problems Officials said staff are continuing to rove the county hopping from site to site to fix the issues  At sites that remain impacted voters have the option of placing their ballot in a secure box to be tabulated later going to another location to vote or returning later in the day to the same location in hopes the problem will be fixed  Election Day coverage Live voting updates  Arizona election results  If voters decide after checking in at a polling site to go to another location or return later to vote officials say they must inform poll workers so that they can be checked out election officials said That will ensure they are able to vote a standard ballot later in the day or at a different location  As the problems continued voters were quick to share their frustration Josh Erb who tried to vote at the Mountain Park Health Center Baseline Clinic in south Phoenix said hell need to come back to the same site once he gets off work  They said that we can slide it in the machine but I dont want to risk it Erb said If its not working Im not going to place my vote  Sandra Tufel went to cast her ballot at the Queen Creek Library about 7 am and encountered the tabulator issue  People werent happy she said Im going to have to trust the system and trust my ballot will be counted It was a frustrating experience  Heres what you need to know about the problems  Arizona election officials provide update on voting tabulators Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chariman Bill Gates and Recorder Stephen Richer give an update regarding tabulators not working on Nov 8 2022 Maricopa County  What is a tabulator and why is it important  Maricopa County uses several different machines at its vote centers electronic checkin stations ballotondemand printers and the tabulators where paper ballots are fed after people vote  Although theyre often referred to as voting machines voters dont actually vote on tabulators Rather a tabulators job is to count the paper ballot that voters fill out  There are several different brands of tabulators but Maricopa County uses Dominion ones The machines are generally new Those used in the 2020 election were permanently compromised by the Arizona Senates election review officials said The county spent millions to purchase new machines and then destroy the old equipment that was subpoenaed for the Cyber Ninjasled audit  The county has used tabulators for decades according to officials  What are voters options  Voters at impacted polling sites can still cast a ballot officials say  If a tabulator is not working at a site they have the option of casting their ballot and placing it into a secure slot in the tabulator labeled door 3 Ballots in this secure box will be tabulated later either at the countys main tabulation center or onsite at polling locations by a bipartisan team of poll workers  This is something that weve had in place for decades Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said Weve always had this secure door and having a backup plan to our backup plan to make sure every voter is able to cast a ballot today is really the most important thing to us  Alternatively voters can go to a different location to cast their ballot  If voters choose to go to a different polling site or return to the same one later after receiving their ballot they should ask poll workers to help them check out Gilbertson said  They need to check out because it looks like they voted at that location she said  That way theyll be able to later vote a standard ballot as opposed to a provisional  Provisional ballots are used when there is uncertainty about a persons eligibility to vote and are designed to ensure nobody is excluded from voting because of an administrative error  When a provisional ballot is cast it is kept separate from others until after the election Then elections staff determine whether the voter actually was eligible to vote and whether the ballot should be counted  If a voter forgets to check out and receives a provisional ballot Gilbertson said there is a backup plan  The guidance that weve provided to our poll workers is to write down the name of those voters and all of their voter information Theyll do an incident form inside of the voting location and those will be researched on the back end  If election officials are able to verify that the voter didnt cast a ballot at the first location theyll count the provisional ballot  There are no marks or codes on a ballot that identify the voter who cast it but Gilbertson said officials will be able to compare the number of checkedin voters at each site to the number of ballots received at that polling place and compare the names of checkedin voters to the names written down by poll workers at other sites  How did the issue happen  Officials say they used the same printer settings Tuesday as they did in Augusts primary election  That election was marred by minor issues with smearing pens but no problems with timing marks  Recorder Stephen Richer said Tuesday that he didnt know how the problem occurred but that he wasnt responsible for tabulation  Gilbertson said Elections Department staff had tested the tabulators before the election  It is something that were going to be looking into further in the coming weeks Gilbertson said  Richer said he felt for any voter who has been frustrated or inconvenienced today in Maricopa County in a statement released on social media  Every legal vote will be tabulated Richer said I promise  The county recorder is generally responsible for voter registration and early voting The county Board of Supervisors is tasked with running emergency voting Election Day and tabulation  Any ballots placed into the door 3 slot will be tabulated securely at the downtown election center under watch of the

spend life in prison six times over for the death and injuries he caused in the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade attack  His sentencing Wednesday closed a tragic book in Waukeshas history something city officials addressed Thursday amid of summary of news events involving Brooks and upcoming holiday events one year following the 2021 incident  Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Dorow on Wednesday formally sentenced Brooks to consecutive life sentences for firstdegree intentional homicide with no chance of parole in the deaths of Tamara Durand Wilhelm Hospel Jane Kulich Leanna Owen Virginia Sorenson and Jackson Sparks  She also sentenced Brooks to 17½ years for each of the 61 counts of firstdegree recklessly endangering safety or a total of 762 years of initial confinement and 305 years of extended supervision and 25 years each for the six hitandrun counts running concurrent to the reckless endangerment charges  In all beyond his life sentences he was sentenced to more than 1200 years including extended supervision  For each life sentence given for the six deceased victims the gallery mainly consisting of victims of the tragedy erupted into applause While Dorow allowed the applause for those who died in the attack she asked that they remain quiet for the rest of the sentencing Despite the gallerys applause their faces remained somber many sniffing back tears  One day after loved ones and victims of the Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy presented impact statements ahead of the sentencing of Brooks Brooks himself spoke for more than two hours in his final statement to the court  More than 40 victims and family members of victims either took to the stand or submitted written statements almost all directly addressing Brooks angrily and bluntly Most also asked Dorow to ensure Brooks would live out his life in prison with some wishing him only pain for the lives he took or shattered  Six people died and at least another 61 others were injured when a red Ford Escape driven by Brooks tore through the holiday parade on Nov 21 2021 The attack left in its wake what police called a chaotic atmosphere as authorities and others scrambled to help victims over a fourblock stretch  Brooks 40 of Milwaukee was convicted on Oct 26 on all 76 criminal charges he faced in the parade attack trial six counts of firstdegree intentional homicide 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety six counts of hitandrun causing death two counts of bail jumping and one misdemeanor count of battery  Brooks 18day trial represented the end of a long legal process that included dramatic shifts beginning with charges filed two days after the parade and continuing with pretrial hearings just days before the trial began The trial was replete with disruptions and delays from Brooks who decided just days before the proceedings began that he would represent himself  City officials speak about relief and healing  As a followup to Wednesdays sentencing three city officials gathered in Waukesha City Hall as part of an invitation to local media to simultaneously question them on related topics Collectively they said they were relieved justice has been served and the community can move forward  They also said they hope the healing can begin They expressed satisfaction over Brooks lifetime sentences and want the city to press on following the completion of the trial and the oneyear remembrance ceremony taking place Monday as well as the lighting festival Dec 2 and Christmas parade Dec 4  What stood out for me was the sentencing said Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly reflecting on key moments of the trial Thats really the only thing I watched of the trial  It was pretty much a foregone conclusion about what the net result but listening Judge Dorow go through her reasoning and her sentencing made me feel good  Reilly noted he wasnt personally affected as deeply as victims but still felt relief as did many of the people he spoke to who had testified Just getting past the trial it does help I think the entire community heal  For people such as those families who presented victim impact statements who still retain anger and hatred for Brooks Reilly encouraged them to seek help and counseling to work through their deep feelings  Anger and hatred is a natural reaction he said Many people heard me say this but my advice to people was dont watch the trial It wasnt going to help you For me it didnt help It made me very angry to see what happened But hopefully hatred and anger will give way to thinking of yourself and making yourself happy  Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson who experienced the tragedy in his first full year on the job acknowledged the recovery process isnt over for his staff  Its still affecting us Thompson said adding that he expects the trauma of 2021 will resurface on the anniversary Our officers are traumatized  It was a war zone  He said the sentencing and the sense of justice have helped but the officers also needed counseling helping them realize it was OK to hurt He said the same is true for victims and others still struggling  MoreFor shop owners along Waukesha parade route Darrell Brooks verdict never in doubt  Brooks mother Dawn Woods and his grandmother Mary Edwards said he suffers from mental illness and should be treated for it  Prior to sentencing Wednesday several relatives and friends including Brooks mother Dawn Woods spoke on Brooks behalf  Speaking remotely via Zoom Woods called her son broken not an uncaring person despite his courtroom actions and the charges he faced  Mental illness affects everyone It destroys lives and affects family Woods said It is of no fault of their own that they are ill and began to change as a person  She acknowledged that people who act maliciously out of mental illness should be held accountable but through medication therapy and special institutions Woods said people need to show empathy and compassion in that regard  I have been dealing with mental illness for some 30odd years now and heres my take on it Woods said Jail is not the answer  Mary Edwards Brooks grandmother said she asked to speak for two reasons to apologize to those hurt by Brooks actions in the parade particularly the family of Jackson Sparks and to ask for forgiveness  Darrell has lost his mind and his life in the outside world Edwards said and explained Brooks has suffered from bipolar disorder for many years  Michele Alworth a close friend who remembered better times with Brooks said she suffers from medical problems and Brooks assisted her with her needs including in emergency situations She saw a different person than the man convicted by jurors  Saying Brooks had a manic episode that he has blocked out of his memory Alworth said she hopes he gets the help he needs for his mental illness in a qualified institution  Darrell Brooks speaks for nearly two hours about his struggles and beliefs  In tears since his mothers comments Brooks spoke softly and slowly when given the chance to speak on his own behalf choosing to address victim statements and his own infamy  In a rambling nearly twohour statement his focus at first remained on victims comments from Tuesday including things I have struggled with myself  The gallery was at capacity and a group formed outside the courtrooms doors After an hour passed of Brooks statement they began to whisper to each other wondering how long he would be allowed to continue  Reaffirming his Christian beliefs and occasionally quoting from the Bible he said he wanted to clarify what he meant in closing statements when he said his conscience was clear He wanted people to know he was repentant  I made a decision to rededicate myself to Christ when this tragedy happened Brooks said I have repented that I have asked God for forgiveness  Brooks also said he wasnt trying to hide the person he is and from what happened  I want everyone to know including the community of Waukesha not only am I sorry for what happened but that you could not see what was truly in my heart  and all the tears that I dropped he said  But he added Its not me who can take any pain away replace what is lost and bring back joy I think all that comes with belief in Christ and all that comes with time Its a process that we all have to go through  His frustration in not being able to defend himself caused him to act out in court Brooks said adding that he has struggled throughout his life with various issues including physical abuse by the people that are supposed to love you and trying to understand why your mind works like the way it does  Flashes of his anger seen often during the trial and in hearings immediately preceding it returned as he raised his voice to say the parade incident was not not not an attack  This was not an intentional act  Addressing prosecutors particularly Waukesha County District Attorney Sue Opper Brooks said he wanted to take the high road while expressing his frustrations about some of their statements Its not easy being the most hated man on this planet he said adding later Im a human being not a monster  Dorow twice asked Brooks after long intervals if he wished to comment on his sentencing following his conviction  Pressed for an answer Brooks said he wanted to be sentenced somewhere he could be medicated to remove the pain he continues to struggle with mentally and to not be put in a place to just be forgotten about  Brooks attempts to prove that his actions were unintentional were met with disgusted grimaces from the gallery many releasing stifled laughter  Judge Jennifer Dorow refutes mental illness claims and more in sentencing  Then it was Dorows turn to address the case in a threehour preamble to sentencing  Because of the nature of the comments Wednesday she began with the claims by Brooks and his family about mental illness as the root cause of the parade incident  Noting that Brooks had at one point pleaded not guilty by reason of mental defect  a plea he ultimately withdrew  Dorow said she has read through four reports from medical psychology experts about his mental state that were initially prepared because his insanity plea  For the first time she confirmed none of those reports supported that special plea  I dont want there to be any doubt that this trial was missing something Dorow said noting that one report was 24 pages that examined a variety of records including mental health documents I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Brooks is competent That was something I was not worried about at any time during this trial  Many in the gallery vehemently nodded in agreement  Dorow noted that his previous mental health reports indicated an antisocial personality disorder not a state of mental illness that would have contributed to the parade incident Quoting from one report she noted that a doctor had noted his lack of remorse and lack of respect for the rights of others  There is no medication for people who do evil Dorow said adding that Brooks clearly understands right and wrong but is fueled by his rage  The bottom line is that none of that caused you to do what you did on Nov 21 2021  Dorow also addressed the particulars of the parade incident based in part on evidence presented at trial starting with the Frame Park incident with his exgirlfriend that triggered his anger  That anger became evident when Brooks began shouting at Dorow during her findings as part of sentencing yelling over her when she tried to address Brooks violent relationship involving his ex whom he continued to discredit He was removed to a neighboring courtroom as a result  Dorow among other points noted his decision not to use safe escape routes to avoid injuries to parade participants at anytime But as she spoke reviewing video evidence Dorow herself broke into tears as she revisited the severe injuries to children in and around the parade  These are just some of the highlights I should call them lowlights about what people testified she said with one piece of evidence coming to mind When Jane Kulich was on Brooks vehicle and then he braked to get her off that vehicle to run her over again  Dorow also shot back on Brooks repeated statements about not understanding the criminal proceedings part of his sovereign citizen defense She called his approach before and during the trial sophisticated and nuanced showing not only his competency but his deep knowledge of the law  The impact on the city of Waukesha as spelled out by those victims who spoke Tuesday was also part of Dorows presentencing statements At times she spoke directly to victims in the gallery including the Xtreme Dance Team and Waukesha South marching band member and victim Tyler Pudleiner and his mother

her emotional testimony  What did this community suffer as a result of this tragedy Dorow asked I think Lori Lochen said it best The loss of a sense of personal safety  As she reviewed the victim statements by the Sparks family Dorow again was moved to tears It was difficult to even watch them make their statements she said her voice again breaking  She referenced Tucker Sparks brother of deceased victim Jackson Sparks survivors guilt which his mother mentioned in her statment Its not your fault Tucker Dorow said Its Mr Brooks fault  Victims in the courtroom comforted each other rubbing each others backs and resting their heads on each others shoulders  Judge Jennifer Dorow waited for a true apology from Brooks to the victims and never got it  Stating that her sentencing decisions are not about Mr Brooks conduct during this trial Dorow said her focus was his actions on Nov 21 2021 moments that are tragic moments that were frankly avoidable and his attempts to flee after striking close to 70 people  With Brooks once more removed from the courtroom again for arguing with her when she tried to begin the sentencing phase she said her sentencing was intended to bring closure to victims especially in view of the loss of life and its reach into the community  While the gallery quietly scoffed at Brooks repeated attempts to reenter the courtroom despite her request that he pledge to halt his interruptions the atmosphere remained serious in anticipation for Dorows sentencing  The seriousness of this offense can be summed up in one word attack Dorow said focusing on what was supposed to be a holiday parade turning into a scene of carnage He chose to drive recklessly maliciously and viciously into the crowd she added  Dorow said she was influenced by the complete disregard for the lives of anyone else which one victim described as depraved indifference she noted that Brooks showed no remorse as victims spoke Tuesday  We may never know the true why but we were provided by nothing today other than a feeble attempt to claim mental health she said I searched for a mitigating factor I waited for a true apology I didnt get it  This is one of the most aggravating cases I have ever presided over Dorow said  Dorow also dove into the conversations with his exgirlfriend and mother of one of his children showing his rage and anger that spilled over into the Christmas parade and demonstrated his poor moral character  She also cited his violent past and criminal record in her decision based on standards of punishment protecting the community and bringing closure to victims  There will be none of the milestones these families are looking for Dorow said Frankly Mr Brooks no one is safe from you  Contact Jim Riccioli at 262 4466635 or

       " {'guid': 14559, 'text_a': 'Earlier this month oldfashioned Xeroxed copies of a newspaper article appeared across the MidMarket neighborhood in Downtown San Francisco The article from the San Francisco Chronicle featured the headline SF DA Brooke Jenkins says shell consider murder charges for fentanyl dealers The article was taped to walls on neighborhood corners regularly frequented by drug dealers At least one of those Xerox copies had the headline translated into Spanish  all the better for the dealers in question most of whom are Honduran nationals to get the message  The photocopies were distributed by Matt Dorsey Supervisor for the district that includes the MidMarket area which is adjacent to the Tenderloin in San Francisco which is both a county and a city Supervisors are the equivalent of City Council members in other cities Dorseys office had organized a neighborhood cleanup and the Supervisor had handed the article for volunteers to promote Dorsey is himself a recovering addict and prior to becoming Supervisor he was the Communications Director for the San Francisco Police Department Ridding the neighborhood of drug dealers is his number one priority  a goal he shares with new District Attorney Jenkins  Across San Franciscos Downtown districts rampant drug use and dealing has led to a surge in crime overdoses and homelessness With office workers staying home and residents fleeing for safer ground only a major shift of political will can prevent the problems from getting worse AP  Strange as it might sound to most nonSan Franciscans the kind of overt political opposition to open drug dealing that Dorsey and Jenkins represent is a challenge to the citys political establishment San Francisco is governed by a leadership that is so enamored of the citys progressive humanitarian selfimage that the idea of enforcing basic laws  even ones that save peoples lives like controlling drug sales and consumption  has come to be regarded as reactionary But conditions in the city have gotten so bad that San Franciscos voters have begun to revolt Living in a city whose downtown doubles as an outdoor drug den is becoming intolerable even for many notoriously tolerant San Franciscans  Open drug use has been normalized to the point there are blocks where the entire sidewalk is filled with people passed out or getting high said Kevin Lee a San Francisco resident who is in recovery himself There is not enough emphasis on creating access to treatment  City Supervisor Matt Dorsey is a former addict who is taking on drug dealers in San Franciscos Tenderloin district who are destroying his citys quality of life AP  In the meantime the citys druginduced mayhem continues unabated A block from where the Xeroxed articles went up for instance is a brand new Whole Foods Market that opened in March of this year The store which is directly across the street from a citysupervised drug consumption site is a monument to the distant prepandemic aspirations of a oncebooming San Francisco Located underground beneath a colossal tower of luxury apartments for tech workers the 65000 square foot market was expected to ride the coattails of the citys exploding knowledge economy  Instead like the rest of the neighborhood the Whole Foods has become a hotbed of petty crime According to interviews with workers there restrooms now include disposal containers for syringes because addicts from the open air drug market that surrounds the building use the toilet stalls as shooting galleries Those addicts treat the stores shelves as a veritable ATM brazenly shoplifting merchandise in clear view of both Whole Foods employees and police officers working overtime shifts on the stores floor  Dorsey hoped these oldfashioned Xerox copies of a recent newspaper article detailing new crime policies would scare outofcontrol drug peddlers  This massive Whole Foods in the MidMarket district was supposed to serve deeppocketed tech workers instead its been invaded by drugusers Google Maps  Once a security guard tried to stop an addict from stealing and was thrown through plate glass near the cheese counter Another security guard who came to his assistance was strangled Management started keeping frequently stolen products in the rear stockroom theyre brought out to customers at the registers upon purchase Undeterred addicts simply began walking into the employeesonly section of the store and rifling through coolers and boxes for coveted merchandise  The once ubiquitous tech workers that were expected to patronize the store are hardly seen in MidMarket anymore When companies began shifting to workfromhome downtown San Franciscos office buildings emptied out By 2024 one study estimates that MidMarket commercial real estate will have a vacancy rate of 43 percent compared to barely 6 percent citywide before the pandemic Prior to the pandemic tech workers on hoverboards coexisted awkwardly with homeless people smoking meth on the sidewalk Now the normal people are mostly gone The streets are almost entirely dominated by the dealers and users of the open air drug market  Across San Franciscos Downtown districts rampant drug use and dealing has led to a surge in crime overdoses and homelessness With office workers staying home and residents fleeing for safer ground only a major shift of political will can prevent the problems from worsening AP  Nor is the chaos contained to the Tenderloin and MidMarket areas The merchandise stolen from Whole Foods like that stolen from Safeway Target CVS Walgreens and every other big box store in downtown San Francisco is sold to fences on the sidewalks of the nearby Mission District which brings the organized larceny industry to that mostly residential neighborhood as well Addicts attracted to San Francisco by the Tenderloins notoriety live in tent encampments scattered all over the city In addition to shoplifting addicts support their habits by breaking into cars and occasionally invading homes The effects of the open air drug market thus ripple through every nook and cranny of San Francisco  San Francisco is a famously tolerant city but beneath this lowlevel mayhem the citys residents who pay some of the highest taxes in the world have been seething at their political leaders  often privately and increasingly publicly The publics exasperation with the political establishment erupted twice already first with the recall of the citys comedically woke school board members in February followed by the recall of former DA Chesa Boudin four months later  Former District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled earlier this year by voters fed up with his softoncrime policies that saw drug deaths and dealing skyrocket AP  Having been appointed in the wake of Boudins demise new DA Jenkins is currently running to be formally elected to her office next month Boudin was a career public defense attorney who essentially turned the prosecutors HQ into a second public defenders office He made a point of avoiding felony prosecutions for drug dealers painting them as victims of human trafficking On Boudins watch dealers became more brazen than ever barely bothering to conceal their transactions while fatal drug overdoses surged in the city claiming more than twice as many lives over the course of the pandemic as Covid Meanwhile Boudins office secured just three convictions for drug dealing in the entire year of 2021 and zero for peddling fentanyl All while some Honduran dealers are making upwards of 1000 per day according to reports from former and current Assistant District Attorneys  Nevertheless most of the citys political establishment with the waffling exception of the Mayor stood firmly behind Boudin Only one of the 11 Supervisors supported the former DAs recall The San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee opposed the recall and recently endorsed Jenkins opponent  a candidate who is if anything even more radical than Boudin  in next months election  San Franciscos notoriously difficult homelessness problem is part of the reason its Downtown lags behind all major American cities in postpandemic economic recovery REUTERS  New San Francisco DA Brooke Jenkins is tougher on crime than her predecessor shes currently campaigning to keep her job and faces a November election AP  Much of San Franciscos political establishment along with the citys Democratic Party has become estranged from the citys heavily Democratic voters said Randy Shaw head of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic which provides housing to indigent San Franciscans Voters rejected the Partybacked Boudin in a landslide yet the Party has gone on to endorse a Boudinbacker against an appointed DA who campaigned for the recall  This has put Jenkins in the strange and politically envious position of being able to run against San Franciscos political machine even though shes the handpicked appointee of the Mayor Thanks to an ideologically intoxicated progressive political establishment increasingly outofstep with San Franciscos voters in next months election Jenkins is at once an insider and an outsider She can have her cake and eat it too  Former San Francisco School Board members Gabriela López l Alison Collins center and Faauuga Moliga r were recalled after focusing on woke issues like renaming schools rather than getting kids back into classrooms during the pandemic  San Franciscos politics are in the early stages of a realignment But that doesnt mean things will change overnight The citys challenges going forward are even worse than those behind it Among the 62 largest cities in America San Francisco already ranks dead last in the postpandemic recovery of its downtown That problem is only going to worsen as commercial real estate contracts that were signed at the height of the tech boom expire and fail to be renewed because employees are now working from home  Meanwhile the citys openair drug problems are likely to become even more dire as a trio of new supervised drugs sites are soon to debut never mind that their infamous predecessor was a spectacular and illegal public failure Downtown will thus continue to be a ghost town thanks to city leaders whose policies embolden drug dealers and users with little or no consequence  Empty office towers and retail shops are now common across Downtown San Francisco The situation will only worsen as additional leases reach their expiration dates Bloomberg via Getty Images  My son is stuck with politicians who just hand addicts free drug paraphernalia and double down on the same failed policies said Jacqui Berlinn who has tried for years to save her son who is a homeless addict in the Tenderloin We finally have a new DA who wants to bring real change but she cant do it until the rest of the citys political leaders start working toward a real solution instead of making the crisis worse  As mounting office vacancies begin to chisel away at the tax base of a city whose social service needs are ballooning with the worsening addiction crisis we might soon see city agencies warring over limited resources exacerbating the political split between progressives and pragmatists  The present dysfunction of San Francisco may thus be just a harbinger of a full blown crisis to come Then again given what passes for governance in San Francisco during normal times perhaps a crisis is just what the city needs to bring it back from the edge of the abyss', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

       " {'guid': 14867, 'text_a': 'SHARM elSHEIKH Egypt AP  Six weeks before taking power Brazilian Presidentelect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday told cheering crowds at the UN climate conference that he would crack down on illegal deforestation in the Amazon revive relationships with countries that finance forest protection efforts and push to host an upcoming world climate summit in the rainforest  In two appearances da Silva laid out a vision for management of the worlds largest rainforest critical to fighting climate change that was in stark contrast to that of President Jair Bolsonaro whose administration witnessed some of the most rapid cutting of forests in decades  There will be no climate security if the Amazon isnt protected said da Silva adding that all crimes in the forest from illegal logging to mining would be cracked down on without respite  Brazilian presidents have a wide range of powers when it comes to monitoring and regulating the Amazon The Ministry of Environment oversees the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources known as Ibama which patrols the forests Federal police work across Brazil including in states with large forest areas and the armed forces can also be deployed  ADVERTISEMENT  Bolsonaro who pushed development both in his probusiness rhetoric and policies made several moves that weakened protections For example he appointed forest managers from the agribusiness sector which opposes the creation of protected areas such as Indigenous territories and pushes for the legalization of land robbing  Many Brazil experts have argued those changes opened the door to widespread criminality the deforested area in Brazils Amazon reached a 15year high from August 2020 to July 2021 according to official figures Satellite monitoring shows the trend this year is on track to surpass last year  The Amazon rainforest which covers parts of several nations in South America combats climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide Its also home to some of the planets most unique animals and plants along with tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years  The appearance at COP27 of da Silva who made an extraordinary political comeback after being convicted of corruption and jailed a few years ago lent both symbolic and practical weight to discussions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help developing nations confront the impacts of climate change Thats because da Silva oversaw large reductions in deforestation as president between 2003 and 2010  ADVERTISEMENT  Lula Lula Lula chanted the crowd before his first appearance in the morning using the name Brazilians universally use for the former president  In that meeting da Silva met with several Brazilian governors including from important rainforest states like Amazonia and Para He also argued that the UN climate summit in 2025 should be based in the Amazon so people who defend the Amazon and defend the climate get to know the region close up He said he would pitch the idea to UN leadership this week  ADVERTISEMENT  During both speeches da Silva took several swipes at Bolsonaro Da Silva beat Bolsonaro in Octobers elections and will assume power Jan 1  Brazil cant remain isolated like it was these last four years Officials from Brazil didnt travel to any other countries and no other countries traveled to Brazil said da Silva  Da Silva also had some strong words for world leaders He mentioned a pledge by rich countries made during the climate conference in 2009 to contribute 100 billion a year to help developing nations adapt to the impacts of climate change That effort has never been fully funded  I dont know how many representatives of rich countries are here said da Silva pausing to smile and look out at the crowd I want to say that my return here is also to collect on what was promised  Without giving details da Silva said his administration would work with the Congo and Indonesia along with Brazil home to the largest tropical forests in the world Given the moniker OPEC of the Forests in reference to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the way they regulate oil production Brazilian news reports have said the general idea would be for these three countries to coordinate their negotiating positions and practices on forest management and biodiversity protection The proposal was initially floated during last years climate summit in Glasgow Scotland according to the reports  ADVERTISEMENT  Despite da Silvas lofty promises the task for the incoming administration is huge While many people particularly environmentalists and officials at a climate conference like this one celebrate promises to protect the Amazon Brazilian leaders have traditionally faced huge development pressures Those pressures come from sectors like agriculture and mining along with many people who live in the Amazon and feel that its for them to decide how the vast area is managed  There is also the reality that da Silvas environmental record as president was mixed Deforestation dropped dramatically during the decade after da Silva took power with Marina Silva former childhood rubbertapper who worked closely with murdered environmentalist Chico Mendes as environmental minister But in his second term da Silva began catering to agribusiness interests and in 2008 Marina Silva resigned Marina Silva is also attending COP27 and is a contender for the top environmental job again  ADVERTISEMENT  Sassan Saatchi a NASA scientist and forest expert said successfully stemming deforestation would require several things from stronger governance to economic initiatives that gave opportunities to people living in the Amazon  There is no one silver bullet said Saatchi attending the climate conference The question is how to put those things together  Da Silva has several meetings planned with ministers from various countries over the next days  On Tuesday night da Silva met with US Climate Envoy John Kerry On Wednesday Kerry said he was pleased that da Silva talked about for once and for all getting it right pulling people together in order to preserve the Amazon  Simone Karipuna an activist from the Amazon traveled with several other Indigenous women to Egypt to participate in the summit Between chants with several other women

hearing at the Statehouse in Indianapolis July 26 2022 The debate over a limited set of circumstances in which abortion could be legal is causing divisions among GOP lawmakers in some states  Danger of overreach  In the midterms President Joe Biden campaigned on abortion rights calling on Congress to codify Roe But that effort is stalled leaving abortion access to the states for the foreseeable future In a tacit acknowledgment of that reality the Biden administration has pledged to ensure that women who want or need to travel across state lines to access the procedure will not be impeded  In the new divided Congress both parties may try to pass bills with no chance of becoming law just to make a point But theres a danger of overreach  on both sides  There will probably be an effort to pass some kind of national abortion ban which is the very definition of outside the mainstream if it includes no exceptions for rape or incest says Republican pollster Whit Ayres  Republicans won control of the House because voters want them to do something about inflation crime and border security Mr Ayres says  not to ban all abortions or cut off aid to Ukraine or conduct endless investigations into the Biden administration  GOP politicians who support abortion rights  a small universe represented most prominently by Sens Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine

country helping to rally the Democratic base Vice President Harris was seen by some as an especially effective voice on the issue as women of color are disproportionately affected by the demise of Roe  Professor Grossmann inserts a note of caution He agrees that the high courts landmark ruling in Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization which overturned Roe gave Democrats a burst of energy But over the course of the campaign he notes polls showed the issue fading with suburban women shifting back toward Republicans over the economy and crime  If the elections had been held in August Democrats probably would have done even better Professor Grossmann says  The next cycle  Certainly by 2024 the issue landscape will have evolved The state of the economy matters more in presidential races than in midterms and if high inflation and other economic challenges persist when voters go to the polls the Democrats could face stiffer headwinds  Some antiabortion Republicans are also working to improve the public image of their sides advocacy efforts Melissa Hart a former member of Congress from the Pittsburgh area just joined the board of an organization called Vision for Life which advertises the services of pregnancy care centers Liberals often vilify such centers saying they deceive women in crisis pregnancies to steer them away from abortion  People decry prolifers and say they dont care about the baby when shes born Ms Hart says Pregnancy care centers do everything  medical care clothing diapers finding housing A lot of people dont know about that  News organizations are already starting to publish stories reflecting the reallife impact of the Dobbs ruling and more are certain to follow These could feature women in restrictive states trying to obtain an abortion women who encounter roadblocks and end up having the baby doctors navigating risky legal terrain All could further influence the national debate  Presidential candidates will also be pressed to take a clear stand on the issue Mr Trump who has already declared his candidacy now has Roes demise as part of his legacy as he nominated the Supreme Court justices who provided the pivotal votes But so far he has not been trumpeting his role in overturning a nationwide right to abortion  Floridas GOP governor Ron DeSantis has also kept relatively quiet on abortion Hes fresh off a landslide reelection and polls show is the top potential primary opponent to Mr Trump yet the issue could be tricky for him Florida already limits abortion to 15 weeks gestation with no exception for rape or incest and some state Republicans now want further restrictions Republican supermajorities in the state legislature render Democrats powerless  Get stories that  empower and uplift daily By

strongly opposes abortion to secure the GOP nomination But if successful hed likely want to distance himself from hardline views to try to win the general election  If Ron DeSantis moves to a more extreme position it will damage his opportunity in 2024 says Karen Finney a Washingtonbased Democratic strategist Congress is highly unlikely to pass legislation that codifies Roe she adds which means the spotlight will remain in the states', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

liable to rear right out of the ground  Today it would be untruthful to answer to the soul of Webster that our Union is rockbottomed and coppersheathed one and indivisible  For the divisions among us replicate those Webster witnessed in his last years before the War Between the States  A Gallup survey reports the lowest figure ever recorded 38 for that share of our population that proclaims itself to be extremely proud to be Americans Another 27 say they are very proud  But the share of our people who say they are only moderately proud or a little proud or not at all proud to be Americans adds up to a third of the nation  In the past those extremely or very proud to be Americans used to average 80 of the country Now it is down to 65  To love ones country Edmund Burke said ones country ought to be lovely It would appear that 1 in 3 Americans more than 100 million of us no longer see our country as truly lovely  While patriotism and pride in US citizenship and in being part of this national community are eroding other problems are being revealed by public surveys  In a new APNORC poll 85 of all Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction with 92 of Republicans believing this to be true and 78 of Democrats agreeing  On July 5 a Monmouth poll reported that President Joe Bidens approval rating had sunk to 36 with 59 disapproving of his presidency  As for our Democraticled Congress 15 of all Americans approved of its performance with 85 disapproving  Another Gallup survey from July 5 reported that this last year has seen a fall in public confidence in every one of 16 major US institutions  The institutions in which Americans now place the least confidence are the presidency newspapers the criminal justice system big business television news and at rock bottom Congress Only 7 of Americans have great confidence or quite a bit of confidence in Capitol Hill  The institutions that enjoy the greatest measures of confidence  though here too the levels are receding like Lake Mead  are small business the military the police the medical system and religious institutions  That small business is the most trusted of American institutions suggests that Bidens attack on the alleged greed of gas station owners may not be politically wise  American institutions that tend to be conservative  small business the military cops  are where the American people repose the greatest confidence Journalistic institutions  newspapers and TV news  both largely liberal appear to be ones in which the nation reposes the lowest levels of confidence and the greatest deposits of distrust  Why are Americans so down on their country and disapproving of its direction and of their president who is leading them  Surely the pandemic which has taken a million lives in 30 months and infects 10 times as many of us today as it did a year ago with the death toll roughly the same now as then is a primary cause  The crisis at the Mexican border where a quarter of a million illegal migrants enter our country uninvited every month with cartel mules ferrying the fentanyl and other narcotics that kill tens of thousands of young Americans every year is surely another  Then there is the worst inflation in 40 years and the record rise in the price of food and fuel for Americas families  Also since the first of the year there have been an average of 10 mass shootings a week where a criminal gunman wounds or kills four or more victims Major atrocities like Buffalo New York Uvalde Texas and Highland Park Illinois dominate the news for days  And each weekend seems to bring a new casualty report of the dead and wounded from Chicagos streets that reminds us of the early days of Vietnam  Then there is the poisonous character of American politics  In the 2016 campaign Hillary Clinton famously described half of the supporters of Donald Trump as a basket of deplorables  They are said Hillary racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic  irredeemable  bigots all  Following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v Wade and sending the issue of abortion back to the states for decision the term fascist has been applied by the left to its righttolife opponents  Which makes one wonder  If Republicans capture two or three dozen House seats in this falls midterm elections would that constitute a triumph of American fascism  And how

       " {'guid': 15552, 'text_a': 'WASHINGTON  Supreme Court oral arguments in a key immigration case grew heated Tuesday as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson President Bidens first nominee to the court rejected the White Houses interpretation of federal law  Jackson accused Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar of having a conceptual problem in her understanding of the Administrative Procedure Act which requires the federal bureaucracy to take certain steps when changing policies  The case brought by Texas and Louisiana challenges Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas 2021 memo that said federal agents should review the totality of an illegal immigrants threat to public safety rather than automatically expel them for certain crimes for which a 1996 law says they shall be detained  The underlying legal dispute is complex and the outcome would bear on only about 60000 to 80000 illegal immigrants who are also criminals Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone acknowledged to justices  but a rebuke of the memo would be a black eye politically for Biden and potentially would allow states more avenues to enforce immigration law which historically has been done at federal discretion  The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in an immigration lawsuit brought by Texas and Louisiana AP  Jackson tore into Prelogar on a single element of the case  telling her that the Biden administration was wrong to say that courts cannot toss out policies that violate the APA which specifies certain steps such as providing public notice and comment periods when regulations are changed  The conceptual problem that Im having with your argument is you point to text context and history and I understand those things but ordinarily theres a symmetry between a claim that has been made in a case and the remedy that is provided to a successful plaintiff Jackson said in one of her first oral arguments since taking office June 30  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last year that authorities shouldnt necessarily deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes listed in a 1996 law Getty Images  The way that you are reading this actually creates a disconnect for me Jackson went on Heres what I mean It is clear that the claim under the APA is about the manner in which the agency has exercised its discretion And we know that agencies have no inherent authority They get all of their power to make valid and legally binding policies from Congress And Congress has said in the APA that in order to make valid and legally binding policies agencies have to follow certain procedures  So when a plaintiff is making a claim under the APA theyre complaining about the agencys failure to follow the procedures that are necessary in order to reach a valid and legally binding result Given that thats the case I think theres a disconnect to say that the successful plaintiff only gets a remedy that is about the application of that rule to them Jackson argued  Their complaint is that the agency did not have the authority to do what it did because it didnt follow the procedures under the APA the newest justice went on It is as though theyre saying what the agency did is void  because they did not follow the procedures that Congress required So I just dont even understand  setting aside like how you read the statute to get to that result  it seems to me to not make sense to say that the remedy is to allow the agency to apply its void defective rule to anyone else whos not the plaintiff  The case deals with an estimated 60000 to 80000 illegal immigrants convicted of crimes AFP via Getty Images  So Justice Jackson I think where I disagree with your analysis isnt suggesting that a plaintiff in a case isnt protesting the application of the invalid agency regulation to that  party Thats the very nature of this kind of dispute Now it might be the case that the argument theyre making is  Prelogar began  Im sorry Jackson interjected its not the nature because obviously they are saying it was applied to them as a matter of standing You have to have it applied to you in order to make the charge But the claim is that the agency has failed to

suggest that the agency regulation is invalid in all of its applications and as applied to other parties too But I still think that in that case just like in the case of interpreting a statute the proper remedy is the partyspecific relief  Jackson concluded the back and forth by saying But we dont have  the APA is a different kind of claim Its not  the statutory claim is not about Congress

to universally invalidate Mayorkas enforcement memo as part of the case  Roberts told Prelogar that stance was fairly radical noting that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals issues similar rulings five times before breakfast  and added that argument could impact thousands of previously decided cases  Stone the Texas solicitor general said a favorable outcome for the Republicanled states would result in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents having a freer hand in taking actions to deport illegal immigrant criminals But he said that Texas only is arguing that federal law requires that ICE

to topple the policy  If all you need to do is to say We have a dollars worth of costs and you dont even need to think about the benefits on the other side  I mean every immigration policy you let in more people you let in fewer people is going to have some effect on the states fiscal condition  every immigration policy Not to mention all the other policies Kagan said  Were just going to be in a

rights has created a new litmus test in Republican presidential politics No longer is it sufficient for a candidate to identify as prolife promise to defund Planned Parenthood or even to provide  as Trump did  a list of potential Supreme Court nominees who would vote to curtail abortion rights  Antiabortion advocates are insisting on more in a postRoe era  namely a hard commitment to back a federal abortion ban  and theyre holding out until they get it  In April DeSantis signed a state law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest  Octavio JonesGetty Images  That means potential Republican presidential hopefuls  such as Trump and Florida Gov Ron DeSantis whose states 15week abortion ban would have been at the leading edge of the antiabortion movement a year ago  enter the 2024 cycle under pressure to go farther Theres already a range of policy positions across the potential GOP field from former Vice President Mike Pences support for a national abortion ban to former UN Ambassador Nikki Haleys recent remarks that abortion should remain a state issue and most have not yet detailed the exact antiabortion policies they would push if elected  But the mounting pressure on the issue puts prospective candidates in a bind between what GOP primary voters will demand and what general election voters will accept  Conservative advocates chalk up the partys midterm performance to candidates who tried to duck the issue of abortion Yet voter outrage over the loss of abortion rights also played a big role in Republicans losses in 2022 when independents swung against the party despite concern about the economy under President Joe Biden And while the tension between catering to the base in a primary and the need to cultivate mass appeal for a general election is a staple of politics the difference now is that elected officials can actually make good on oncetoothless pledges to outlaw abortion  Were living in a different world now said Matt Wolking a Republican strategist who has worked for the campaigns of Virginia Gov Glenn Youngkin and President Donald Trump Its no longer a hypothetical  Even within the antiabortion movement early fissures are emerging Some groups are demanding 2024 contenders push for nothing less than a complete ban on abortion starting at conception while others urge a less hardline stance saying theyre open to 15week bans or other incremental steps they see as more politically realistic  We know there has to be a coming together on these issues in the states and there will have to be at the federal level as well said Marilyn Musgrave a former GOP congresswoman and the vice president of government affairs for SBA We do not apologize for saving as many lives as we can on the way to ending abortion  Conservative groups that spent tens of millions boosting abortion opponents in the midterms are now planning to dole out even more on the fight for the presidency They are creating candidate questionnaires scheduling straw polls among their devotees and sending out invitations for GOP aspirants to pitch themselves to the antiabortion movement at their galas conferences and marches early next year  SBA has also thrown its muscle behind a national 15week abortion ban authored by Sen Lindsey Graham RSC Many Republican lawmakers have been leery of backing the bill saying they prefer the debate to play out at the state level Graham confirmed he plans to reintroduce the bill in 2023 further squeezing GOP lawmakers with an interest in running for president  Each person running for the White House will have to come up with an answer to the question postDobbs Should we consider this a states rights issue or a human rights issue Graham said in an interview The prolife community is still a strong component of the Republican Party and if youre running for president I think in certain states like South Carolina the position that the unborn have no voice in our nations capital will be a tough sell for the prolife community  But there is also strong sentiment in the antiabortion movement that the Graham bill doesnt go nearly far enough given that more than 90 percent of abortions in the US are performed before 15 weeks of pregnancy While SBA is backing the bill the group sees it as a bare minimum and would also support going further  If youre not addressing the kind of abortion that is most common youre not really addressing abortion at all said Students for Life chief policy strategist Kristi Hamrick  Now the 2024 presidential primary is kicking off amid that tension  Where the contenders stand  Many conservatives are worried that despite his policy record Trump would be a toxic force for the antiabortion cause going forward Thats especially true after so many of the candidates he endorsed in the 2022 midterms lost races Republicans had been counting on to win back the Senate  Look Im appreciative of everything he put in place Tony Perkins the president of the Family Research Council told  Evangelical voters and conservative voters have great admiration and appreciation for him but they still want a vision cast for the future and they dont want to go through four years of relitigating 2020  Trump didnt once mention abortion or the fall of Roe in his grievanceladen speech announcing his 2024 campaign sparking conservative concerns that he wont prioritize the issue in a third White House bid  He might not always be as vocal as we want him to be said Bob Vander Plaats a prominent Christian conservative activist in Iowa and the president of The Family Leader He was silent for a while after the overturn of Roe v Wade  but his actions were good on this issue  You really have to have a certain standard and you have to talk about it I say you have to go with the three exemptions  rape incest and life of the motherI think having the exceptions is a very important thing Donald Trump speaking to conservative talk show host Wayne Allyn Root in October  Vander Plaats opposed Trump during the 2016 campaign but now thanks him for his work advancing the antiabortion cause Still he has been outspoken against Trump running again in 2024  Additionally in recent interviews with conservative outlets Trump has said he favors exceptions for rape incest and protecting the life of the mother a position at odds with some antiabortion leaders who view rape and incest exceptions as punishing a child for the sins of a parent  In addition a policy blueprint released in December by dozens of senior Trump administration alumni does not call for national limits on abortion instead arguing the Dobbs ruling pushed the issue of abortion rightfully back to the states  President Trump achieved generational change by appointing Supreme Court justices and federal judges who have protected the life of the most vulnerable Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote in a statement There has been no president in history who has been a bigger champion on this issue His sterling record of achievement speaks for itself  Across the spectrum of 2024 hopefuls all of the main contenders say they identify as prolife But among that short list of Republican stars there remain distinctions  some of them deal breakers for advocacy groups For example Pence a favorite in the movement would support a national abortion ban But Trump has not gone further than welcoming the Dobbs decision as an opportunity for states to decide and he has not endorsed the Graham bill or another federal ban thus far  Like Trump many conservatives have argued for decades that state and local governments should set abortion policy  and criticized Roe for blocking them But SBAs Dannenfelser called this an unacceptable position for any 2024 GOP presidential contender to hold and a death sentence to unborn babies in blue states  Im willing to sign great life legislation Ron DeSantis speaking at a December press conference  Pence has repeatedly touted and taken credit for the antiabortion policies of the Trump administration openly courting the support of antiabortion groups as he considers a 2024 run  In recent interviews Pence has said he would support Grahams 15week nationwide abortion ban if he were still in Congress and he has teamed up with Dannensfelser to call for advancing antiabortion measures nationwide  Since leaving the White House he has raised money for crisis pregnancy centers appeared at antiabortion events and is also expected to appear again at the March for Life in January  which will mark what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe An aide said hes planning to provide refreshments to marchers along the route at the office of his nonprofit Advancing American Freedom  There are some in our party who might not want to talk about the issue but he thinks we should take our case to the people and explain why we champion life Marc Short an adviser to Pence told   Yet Pence who lags behind Trump and DeSantis in early polling also has some baggage on the issue Ironically a neartotal abortion ban signed by his successor as Indiana governor was just blocked in court for violating the religious freedom law Pence signed in 2015 Jewish residents of the state argued successfully that the abortion restrictions violate their religious liberty as Judaism allows and in some circumstances requires the right to terminate a pregnancy  The new vanguard  With Pence on a book tour and Trump struggling to get his campaign off the ground conservative groups are also turning their eyes toward current GOP governors who have signaled interest in a White House bid Movement leaders argue these officials will have an advantage because they can spend the next couple years showing  not just telling  voters what they believe when it comes to abortion  I think youre going to see more and more governors who have established a track record who will be the favorites of prolife voters Perkins said Republicans have talked about being for life  Now its no longer words people are going to be looking for actions  We must resolve that we will not rest we will not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the nation Mike Pence in a speech at Florence Baptist Temple in Florence SC in July  Several antiabortion movement leaders called DeSantis a strong contender  but warned he faces unique risks should he decide to run for president  In April DeSantis signed a state law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest At the time he and his allies offered conflicting messages about the new law casting it both as a reasonable and moderate compromise and just the first step toward a more complete ban on the procedure The restrictions went into effect in July days after the Dobbs ruling  Now with a green light from the Supreme Court to ban abortion entirely pressure is mounting on DeSantis to do more  Fifteen weeks was a great step in the right direction but that was in a preDobbs environment said Andrew Shirvell who leads the lobby and advocacy group Florida Voice for the Unborn This is now the time to put up or shut up Nothing less than the total abolition of abortion will be acceptable  Some governors convened special legislative sessions after the Supreme Courts June ruling to pass additional abortion restrictions DeSantis did not At a press conference in midDecember the governor declined to answer a question about whether he would back a sixweek abortion ban saying only that hes ready to sign great life legislation  Shirvell whose group plans to push for tighter restrictions on abortion in Floridas upcoming legislative session predicted that DeSantis will suffer in a future White House bid if he fails to push a stricter ban into law  Glenn Youngkin has repeatedly pledged to sign a 15week abortion ban with exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother should one ever make it to his desk  Alex WongGetty Images  His opponents whoever they may be will pummel him on this issue he said If he doesnt get this done hes toast  Other antiabortion advocates and GOP insiders disagreed arguing that DeSantis has staked out a consensus position on abortion that will serve him well going forward  and noting that the Mississippi law that ultimately toppled Roe v Wade was itself a 15week ban  Our ultimate objective is to protect every unborn child in the womb but that wont be achievable in any way said Ralph Reed the leader of the Faith  Freedom Coalition So you pass the most strongly prolife legislation you can and you do the same thing we did with Dobbs which is you eat the elephant one bite at a time  Another GOP governor activists are watching as a potential 2024 candidate Virginias Glenn Youngkin is in a similar position  He has repeatedly pledged to sign a 15week abortion ban with exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother should one ever make it to his desk In December he also proposed banning the states Medicaid program from covering abortion in cases of incapacitating fetal deformities  Conservatives should view the end of Roe as a beginningIt should be considered the catalyst that moves us to change our nations culture around abortion Mike Pompeo writing preDobbs for the European Center for Law and Justice  Yet conservatives in the state are eager to go further One bill Virginia lawmakers may debate in January would bar abortion from the moment of conception But unlike DeSantis Youngkin faces a divided legislature and the Virginia state Senates Democratic majority is expected to be a firewall against the push for restrictions easing some pressure on the governor  Other Republican stars are also working to prove their antiabortion bona fides as they weigh presidential runs well aware that they have to navigate a more complex landscape postRoe  Haley has said she is very prolife and as governor of South Carolina in 2016 she signed into law a 20week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest But she has also said that abortion restrictions should be decided at the state level  a point of contention with some antiabortion groups  I have never thought unelected justices should be deciding something this personal Haley said on WMUR in New Hampshire in September So I want to see as many states that are prolife as possible  Nikki Haley has said she is very prolife and as governor of South Carolina in 2016 she signed into law a 20week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest  John LamparskiGetty Images  Referencing the first ballot referendum after Roe was overturned in which Kansas voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have cleared the way for the legislature to pass a ban Haley added As much as I would like Kansas to be prolife the people decided  Mike Pompeo the former secretary of state and Republican congressman who has signaled interest in a White House bid is also courting the support of the antiabortion movement  Pompeo has touted his work in the Trump administration reimplementing and expanding the Mexico City Policy  a ban on US foreign aid going to groups overseas that make referrals for abortions or give patients information about the procedure  and his advocacy for the failed constitutional amendment vote in his home state of Kansas Previously as a member of the House he said he does not support abortion access for victims of rape or incest  Now with Roe overturned we will see which politicians supported the prolife cause to win elections and which actually believed it he tweeted this summer  Most likely GOP candidates however have not outlined their positions on abortion with the level of detail activists are seeking  including when in pregnancy they believe access to the procedure should end and what kinds of exceptions they support  Its wise for candidates to have more details rather than less and were glad to help people develop those details should they need it Hamrick said adding that candidates face a different ballgame now that Roe has been eliminated Politicians of all kinds were able to hide behind slogans for so many years Not anymore If you wish to engage politically at this time you have to be prepared to speak to this  A delicate dance  All candidates running in 2024 will face heightened scrutiny of their records and platforms on abortion But they will also have to calibrate how they talk about it in every interview speech and piece of campaign literature  Message discipline will be very important Wolking cautioned This is a topic where its easy to make a misstep  Vander Plaats agreed saying that while opposing abortion should be an easy one for Republican candidates coming through the early caucus state of Iowa White House hopefuls will have to tread carefully  All the presidential candidates they all will talk about how they value life and champion the sanctity of human life he said I dont think you should hide from it but the question is how do you message it and if people sense a degree of compassion when you do message it  I believe life begins at conceptionI believe we can get a 15week pain threshold done in Virginia I do believe that there should be exceptions made in the case of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is truly at risk Glenn Youngkin to CBS Face the Nation in July  Several Republicans running in competitive races in 2022 learned the hard way that the wrong abortion message can help kill a campaign  Pennsylvania Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz declared during a televised debate that abortion should be a decision between women doctors and local political leaders Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon said she didnt support abortion exemptions for a 14yearold rape survivor because having a baby can be healing in that circumstance Other losing candidates including Arizona Senate nominee Blake Masters scrubbed antiabortion rhetoric and rewrote the policy positions on their websites as they headed from primaries into general elections  Democratic campaigns and progressive advocacy groups seized on these developments in the leadup to the midterms cutting attack ads and massively outspending the GOP on messaging related to abortion  They plan to keep up the pressure heading into 2024 NARAL Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights advocacy groups say theyll be expanding their permanent yearround presence in key swing states like Wisconsin Georgia Arizona and Nevada They are also laying the groundwork for future state ballot referendum fights to add to the six they won in 2022  For organizing to be effective you cant just do it every two years NARAL President Mini Timmaraju told  Now is the opportunity for us to really flex our muscles  Republicans are saying this doesnt need to be decided by unelected justices It needs to be decided by the people Nikki Haley in a September interview with NH Journal  Many Republicans and conservative advocacy groups are also urging prospective candidates to go on the offensive That means attacking Democrats for their opposition to abortion restrictions at any stage of pregnancy and their votes against the Hyde amendment the longstanding ban on federal funding for abortion  I think youll see more efforts by Republicans particularly in swing states to label the position of the Democratic party as extremely extreme said Graham one of several Republicans who argue this is an effective response to Democratic attacks on abortion that the party didnt use enough this year  But antiabortion groups remain worried that GOP candidates  still reeling from the 2022 results  will shy away from the issue going forward Now they are trying to make the case that theres a greater risk of depressing Republican turnout if they sidestep the issue  When you look at the three legs of the Republican base  economic conservatives national defense conservatives and social conservatives  were the foot soldiers Hamrick said Were the people who door knock not the people who want a flat tax Were the ground game', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

making what are expected to be the largest corporate staff cuts in its 28year history axing as many as 10000 corporate employees or about 3 percent of the companys office staff Rumors continue to spread internally that the number of job cuts might grow either through traditional layoffs or by pushing out more employees than usual for unsatisfactory performance with one publication reporting that 20000 cuts are the actual target And Amazon began quietly rescinding job offers to future employees as well This is upending the lives of wouldbe staff and threatening the companys reputation in the job market for technical talent  where it was already facing challenges according to a leaked internal memo exclusively viewed by Recode  A company spokesperson confirmed that job offers were pulled which was first reported by The Information but declined to disclose specific numbers Even without knowing exactly how many offers the company has rescinded current and future Amazon employees alike are shocked  underscoring the rarity of the current costcutting climate at the tech giant and raising the question of what these pullbacks signal for the economy as a whole Inside the company some employees are questioning whether Amazon will still prioritize pursuing big ideas that dont generate immediate financial payoff Crucially much of Amazons success can be attributed to investing in projects that werent profitable in the short run but which with Wall Streets backing allowed the company to increase its market share and power in a given sector by focusing instead on growth  The question among employees is Does this mean we should only be on teams that add revenue or that we think are the most safe an Amazon senior manager of more than 10 years told Recode Thats very damaging to the Think Big and Invent and Simplify ethos of this company Those are two of the 16 leadership principles that are supposed to guide how work gets done inside Amazon  Are you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts or tips on this topic Please email Jason Del Rey at jasonrecodenet or jasondelreyprotonmailcom His phone number and Signal number are available upon request by email  Yet the problem with looking for deeper meaning in Amazons recent moves  beyond what we already know about its leaders being leery about the future of the economy and that they bet that a pandemicfueled ecommerce boom would continue longer than it did  was that Amazon has been in a league of its own as a hiring machine Between 2019 and 2021 Amazon doubled its employee count adding 800000 employees in just two years including warehouse employees Amazon now also has more than 300000 tech and corporate employees across the globe  No company had hired like Amazon had in the previous decade said Amazons former head of communications Craig Berman who left the company in 2018 after 14 years And so I hesitate to even start to guess at what this could mean because there is nothing historical to base the reaction on  As a result the bewilderment felt by employees and wouldbe future employees in the wake of the layoffs and job rescissions is understandable Berman said especially since the company has not had major job cuts in more than 20 years and largely kept its foot on the gas even during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009  They seemed immune Berman said  Amazons new reality has been a harsh wakeup call for wouldbe employees Several told Recode they were counting on the job to remain in or reenter the US on a work visa and were distraught over needing to find new employment in a short period of time One employee who had their job offer pulled in late November had just received it in September with a start date planned for January Another employee who was slated to start working in a highpaying technical role in the retail division in January was offered a job in October only to have it pulled back the next month  I think the worst part for Amazon is the damage theyve done to their reputation this person told Recode  The employee said they mainly chose Amazon over offers from rival companies because the Seattlebased tech giant was offering a significantly higher pay package If the financials had been more equal they said they would have likely chosen a competitor with a better reputation for worklife balance  While Amazon had long remained a stable corporate hirer that kept adding new lucrative roles every year  especially as its stock price rose consistently for much of the past decade  it also developed a reputation among some staff as a sometimes brutal and cutthroat workplace and one where some employees from underrepresented backgrounds felt discriminated against or worse Earlier this year Insider reported that highperforming employees were leaving Amazon corporate divisions at double the normal rate And according to an internal Amazon memo from June that Recode reviewed perception of the companys corporate culture already seemed to be having a negative impact on recruiting even before this cycle of layoffs and pulled offers began  The internal memo cited a LinkedIn survey of more than 7000 software developers who werent working for Amazon at the time Among a set of 25 top tech competitors Amazon only ranked 19th for good worklife balance while it came in 10th for flexible work arrangements and 11th for ongoing employee training  development These rankings the memo stated were hurting recruiting with 40 percent fewer job seekers applying for software development jobs at Amazon in May than in January  Those preexisting recruitment issues could now be exacerbated by the tech giant slashing roles and rescinding job offers Amazon seems aware of this and is attempting damage control For those who have had an Amazon job offer reversed the company will pay them a months worth of the base pay they were set to make  Its going to have an impact on your employer brand Tom Wilson president of the HR executive search firm Frederickson Partners said of companies that rescind job offers  But whether the onemonth payment is enough to fortify the companys reputation as a top employer is an open question  Despite offering buyouts to at least hundreds of its recruiters Amazon expects to hire in some growing areas in 2023 such as Amazon Web Services even as it retrenches in others like Alexa and its core retail business After all if it wants to compete for top tech talent as it pursues ambitions in other industries ranging from ecommerce to video streaming to cloud computing to advertising it needs to improve its reputation While 10000 job cuts only represent approximately 3 percent of all its corporate roles this is a shift thats foreign to most employees at Amazon and those who once saw the company as their dream employer', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

including his forthcoming coedited work Myth America Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past Basic Books Follow him on Twitter julianzelizer The views expressed in this commentary are his own View more opinion on      Concluding its final public meeting Monday the House January 6 committee released a summary of its key findings  the conclusions of which are devastating even if they lack all the details expected in the final report  Julian Zelizer   Following 18 months of deliberations and hearings more than 1000 witnesses and countless documents the committee has produced a blistering account accusing former President Donald Trump and his allies of attempting to overturn the 2020 election  For anyone who continues to believe that the January 6 2021 insurrection was exaggerated or was a haphazard amateurish effort gone bad the final report should throw cold water on those beliefs The committees recommendations are historic  The panel made four criminal referrals against Trump including charges of insurrection to send to the US Justice Department If the United States is to survive as a nation of laws and democracy the committees chairman Rep Bennie Thompson said we can never let this happen again  The referral is largely symbolic because it doesnt obligate federal prosecutors to bring criminal charges  But the committees findings have provided a formidable body of evidence that there was an elaborate effort led by the President of the United States and his Republican allies in Congress to systematically overturn an election that he lost  The committee documented what it said was Trumps intentionality strategy and planning behind the dangerous effort to overturn votes to find new votes and ultimately to stoke an attack on the US Congress even though he knew he had lost  President Trump was informed over and over again by his senior appointees campaign experts and those who had served him for years the executive summary states that his election fraud allegations were nonsense The panel relied on the testimony of some of Trumps top advisers to build its case as well as the public record  The committee found that Trump stoked the violence with incendiary tweets and that the White House was purposely slow in responding to the insurrection at the US Capitol  Citing former President Ronald Reagan a conservative icon Rep Liz Cheney one of the panels two Republicans argued that the peaceful transfer of power was a miracle of our system and only one President  Trump  had failed to abide by this process  When the mob attacked the Capitol Cheney added Trump engaged in shameful behavior by sitting and watching the violence on television His actions Cheney said were unlawful and an utter moral failure and a clear dereliction of duty When he finally agreed to call off his supporters Rep Elaine Luria noted he did so with language that justified what the rioters had done  The findings certainly rank among the worst scandals in presidential history It is fair to say that a sitting President being part of a concerted effort to reverse his own election stands alongside the abuses of power that President Richard Nixon engaged in and the violations of law under the Reagan administration exposed during the IranContra hearings  Without question the revelations far overshadow the allegations that were at the center of President Bill Clintons impeachment  In other words the committee concluded that Trump made history by participating in an unrivaled abuse of presidential power that threatened the very foundation of our democracy elections While the term unprecedented has been grossly overused in this case the term works  But the question is what impact will the January 6 committees final report have when its released Wednesday  The committee has done its business at a moment in American history when shock and awe among the public seem impossible The historic impact of congressional investigations has always depended on the ability of elected officials to move the political needle by producing findings that prove a leader acted far outside the parameters of whats acceptable  The smoking gun tape that allowed legislators to hear Nixon obstructing an investigation were enough in 1974 for politicians in both parties to say enough  The discoveries that national security officials in the Reagan administration violated the Boland Amendment by sending money and arms to the Nicaraguan Contras caused Reagans approval ratings to plummet and put his legacy in jeopardy  The President was only saved by the fact that the committee could not directly connect the illicit operation to him and by the fact that the administration mounted an effective public relations campaign to win back public support Congressional Democrats moreover decided that they wouldnt pursue impeachment  Even Clintons scandal which was over an issue far less relevant than what faced Nixon or Reagan clearly contradicted his public statements and legal testimony about the subject after DNA evidence emerged of his affair with Monica Lewinsky  We live in a period today where it is unclear that any congressional investigation can still have an outsize impact One of the factors that makes it difficult for Congress to shift political momentum is that intense political polarization overwhelms all other concerns  Even 911 or the pandemic didnt produce a serious political realignment Polarization is almost always triumphant even when the leader of a party is found to have committed egregious abuses of power  Another related challenge stems from what social scientists call asymmetric polarization The Republican Party has moved further to the right than Democrats have to the left And much of the extremism in the GOP has been tactical where some party leaders have embraced a form of smashmouth partisanship with no guardrails as to what is permissible  In this case the odds that the relevant party will change its ways or respond are minimal It is worth remembering that Senate Republicans originally filibustered the plan to set up an independent bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 and did not cooperate with the congressional committee set up instead  The Republicans who did serve on the committee  Cheney and Rep Adam Kinzinger of Illinois  have been attacked marginalized and essentially pushed out of the party During the 2022 midterms election denialism was a central campaign theme for the GOP rather than an issue candidates ran away from  Nor does our media ecosystem lend itself to the sort of reaction that took place with Watergate While there was a time such as the 1970s when professional journalists coalesced around the facts presented by a judicious investigation those times are gone  Partisan media outlets such as Fox News ignore the weight of evidence Show hosts are more than willing to spin the news in a particular direction that satisfies political yearnings  In the coming weeks there will likely be stories that misrepresent what the committee discovered and that will promote conspiratorial claims with no basis in fact The filterless world of social media probably will offer ample opportunity to push disinformation that contradicts the harrowing stories found in the report  The opposition in the congressional investigation of IranContra put out a minority report in 1987 but today that is no longer necessary Opponents of the committee have multiple platforms and opportunities to spin a different tale that undercuts the power that the official findings will have  And some of the forces that will check the impact of the report stem from a broader national culture that seems incapable of staying focused on issues for long In our short attention span everything must be new and fresh we push the media from one issue to the other  and much of the news media happily oblige  with the lightning speed of TV commercials  The January 6 committee already has experienced this challenge as dramatic televised hearings which proved capable of shifting attention to how bad the coup attempt had been were quickly drowned out by the latest celebrity scandal or news story coming from Washington There are so many outlets for information that it is virtually impossible to keep the public eye committed to any single subject  The Watergate scandal was the story that defined much of the period between 1972 and 1974 but for many Americans January 6 has just become one other thing among many that happened in the chaos of our era  Finally Attorney General Merrick Garland now faces a politically perilous decision of whether to indict Trump especially since he is now officially one of President Joe Bidens campaign opponents in 2024 Garland has appointed a special counsel Jack Smith who is overseeing the investigations of Trump and will make recommendation s  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for  Opinions newsletter Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The question is whether this report will push Garland toward taking action to ensure accountability rather than focusing on concerns about fueling division within the electorate  Given its expected dramatic findings the January 6 report is certainly a stress test for the problematic state of our democracy It is unlikely however to change the basic dynamics  Barring successful prosecutions of key players the odds are that within a few months many Americans may tragically think of the report as ancient history rather than compelling evidence accusing a major 2024 presidential candidate of coming close to overturning results of the election system thats the best our democracy has to offer', 'text_b': None, 'label':

more families Even with inflation easing families are still relying on food banks to help feed their families Over a period of a year grocery prices rose 131 Megan Smith   Food banks across the country will enter this holiday season with their resources strained as inflation continues to pummel the economy  Soaring food prices and a drop in donations mean many food bank warehouses are more thinly stocked than in recent years said Katie Fitzgerald chief operating officer at Feeding America a nonprofit overseeing a network of more than 200 food banks across the country  Meanwhile some food banks report they are busier than they were during the worst of the economic shutdown during the pandemic in 2020 Fitzgerald told   Earlier this year over 150 of Feeding Americas 200 food banks reported increased or steady demand for services as food prices increased  With the demand being so great the supply being so short and inflation being high its just a perfect storm for long lines at the bank San Antonio Food Banks president Eric Cooper told   In the Alamo City there arent enough turkeys for all who would like one for their Thanksgiving meal this year he said  Were still pressing forward to make sure we can make it happen for those families Cooper said But the reality is were having to substitute  every day right now  Food prices are up  Food banks get their food through multiple ways including buying it themselves so rising food prices are a problem Fitzgerald said  The story of 2022 is inflation the inflationary food prices she said adding the price of turkey was up 17 in September  The US Department of Agriculture one of the biggest bankrollers of food bank supplies is having a harder time purchasing food for charitable purposes because it too is dealing with inflation in the market according to Fitzgerald  At the West Seattle Food Bank demand has remained just as high as during the peak of the COVID19 pandemic and food is still being given out in the nonprofits parking garage and via home delivery to maintain social distancing  With no end in sight to increasing food prices food bank executive director Fran Yeatts said she doesnt know how the operation will continue serving at its current level  Theres more folks that need our services but then on the flip side its harder for us to be able to purchase as much she said  Among Feeding America network food banks more than 40 are running a budget deficit in their attempt to have enough food  And that is just not sustainable Fitzgerald said  Donations have dropped  Cooper and Yeatts said their food banks saw an influx of cash and food donations during the first year of the pandemic but donations have since dropped  The West Seattle Food Bank is dipping into reserves for the second year in a row relying on the monetary donations squirreled away from two years ago But of course it cant last forever Yeatts said  The year ending in June saw a 7 decrease in donated food compared with the year before according to data from Feeding America  With less food donated by the public food banks will have to continue to buy food themselves and battle inflation  Feeding America network food banks purchased 18 more pounds of food from July to September 2022 compared with the same time in 2021 according to Fitzgerald  Food banks and pantries across the country have also historically gotten donations from manufacturers with surplus supplies on their hands  The San Antonio Food Bank could usually rely on truckloads of cereal and other shelfstable items from bigname factories hundreds of miles away Cooper said  But changes in the labor market and overall economy caused food producers to operate with less staff in recent years and theyve scaled back their operations to make them more efficient according to Cooper  And that just squeezed out the food banks Cooper said  One piece of good news Families on food stamps are just beginning to feel the programs recent 125 jump in benefits to account for inflation  Food bank struggles affect families  In Philadelphias Kensington neighborhood John Brzozowskis bimonthly meal services at the River of Life food pantry have gone from serving 35 people to serving 60 the pastor said  Theres definitely a much higher demand in the community he serves Brzozowski said and the same people go to two or three other food banks a week he said  The people who come to River of Life food pantry arent going without but theyre walking away with lighter loads  We often offer our clients less Brzozowski said Instead of two meat items you might only have one  The effects of an unforgiving pandemic persistent inflation and a sense of uncertainty about the future can be seen on the faces of families who come to the food bank hungry some seeking help for the first time Cooper said  Theyre been pushed over the edge a while ago So theyre still over the edge and theyve been able to mask some of the

       " {'guid': 16697, 'text_a': 'The use of masks to mitigate the spread of COVID19 has lingered as a talking point particularly among conservative politicians even as case numbers and severity of the virus have fallen from the peak of the pandemic  Many leading Republicans have been critical of the preventative measure including among others Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who earlier this year chastised a group of students wearing masks at a public conference and Texas Senator Ted Cruz who has criticized mask mandates  The debate was reignited again this week when a report by the US Department of Health  Humanities HHS sparked rumors that the Biden Administration was trying to once again enforce mask use across the country  The Claim  A tweet posted on November 22 2022 by Senator Marsha Blackburn RTN which has received more than 46000 engagements claims that the Biden White House is trying to implement mask mandates again  Retweet if youre not putting up with this nonsense anymore she added  The Facts  The HHS report released on November 21 2022 makes a series of recommendations about COVID19 preventative measures specifically targeted at preventing Long COVID and protecting those with the illness  According to the HHS Long COVID a term used to describe COVIDassociated chronic illness is said to affect between 77 million to 23 million Americans which it expects will only continue to grow as COVID19 continues to circulate  Per HHS researchers say they have cataloged more than 50 conditions linked to Long COVID that impact nearly every organ system with evidence suggesting that between 5 percent and 30 percent of those who had COVID19 may have Long COVID symptoms  The report follows an April 2022 memorandum by the Biden AdministrationAddressing the LongTerm Effects of COVID19that directed the HHS to coordinate a government wideresponse  Commenting on the report Adm Rachel Levine MD Assistant Secretary for Health said Listening to and learning from the experiences of Long COVID patients is essential to accelerating understanding and breakthroughs The Health Long COVID Report is evidence of our commitment to engaging communities to provide patientled solutions  Commissioned by HHS and produced by Coforma an independent thirdparty design and research agency it is said to combine more than 1000 hours of interviews workshops and research with the American public  The report states This report a result of this process includes an exploration of how and why the impact of Long COVID on individual lives varies from person to person the reasons for which have the potential to increase health disparities between peoples and communities  Addressing the effects of Long COVID it suggests an opportunity to establish public policies that protect everyone from Long COVID which includes the encouragement or mandate policies and protocols regarding masking and social distancing in public spaces that protect people from infection or reinfection and possible Long COVID  However this does not automatically mean that the Biden White House will enforce such mandates and there is nothing in the document that states the White Houses commitment to the reports findings  The Public Health Service Act grants HHS the legal authority for responding to public health emergencies and authorizes the HHS Secretary to lead all Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies  The organization encompasses 12 operating divisions of health and human services that conduct lifesaving research for the nation protecting and serving all Americans  Nonetheless there is nothing to indicate that this provides the authority to immediately introduce or demand the enforcement of the recommendations in its report  Weve been clear that decisions about requiring masks in communities are decisions that should be made by local leaders That continues to be our position the HHS told  in a background comment  The Long COVID report was commissioned by HHS and conducted and produced by an independent thirdparty design and research agency  All recommendations in it are from research participants Long COVID patients their caregivers health care providers advocates and other subjectmatter experts  These insights are valuable as we push forward on advancing our understanding of Long COVID and its impacts  While the White House has enforced mask mandates before its use has been limited in scope  In January 2021 President Joe Biden signed an executive order mandating maskwearing among federal agencies and properties as part of a 100 Day Masking Challenge based on recommendations by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC  Most mask mandates were enforced at the state level many states began lifting these restrictions in early 2021  However even if the White House wished to mandate the use of masks in the future its past record of enforcing such action has not been wholly successful  In April 2022 a Florida judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that a federal transportation mask mandate was unlawful and exceeded the CDCS authority  Following the news airlines began to make the wearing of masks optional   has contacted the White House and Senator Marsha Blackburn for comment  The Ruling  Unverified  A report by the HHS states a series of recommendations that could include encouragement or mandating of maskwearing as a response to Long COVID  It is among a series of recommendations that at least as of November 23 have not been taken up or implemented  Although the HHS holds sway over public health guidance the report does not say whether its recommendations will be federally enforced  President Joe Biden and the White House have not publicly stated that they plan to introduce mask mandates off the back of the report  FACT CHECK BY s Fact Check Team', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

demonstrations  Beijing Chengdu Lanzhou Wuhan among cities with protests                SHANGHAIBEIJING Nov 28   Hundreds of demonstrators and police clashed in Shanghai on Sunday night as protests over Chinas stringent COVID restrictions flared for a third day and spread to several cities in the wake of a deadly fire in the countrys far west  The wave of civil disobedience is unprecedented in mainland China since President Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago as frustration mounts over his signature zeroCOVID policy nearly three years into the pandemic The COVID measures are also exacting a heavy toll on the worlds secondlargest economy  Im here because I love my country but I dont love my government  I want to be able to go out freely but I cant Our COVID19 policy is a game and is not based on science or reality said a protester in the financial hub named Shaun Xiao  Protesters also took to the streets in the cities of Wuhan and Chengdu on Sunday while students on numerous university campuses around China gathered to demonstrate over the weekend  In the early hours of Monday in Beijing two groups of protesters totaling at least 1000 people were gathered along the Chinese capitals 3rd Ring Road near the Liangma River refusing to disperse  We dont want masks we want freedom We dont want COVID tests we want freedom one of the groups chanted earlier  A fire on Thursday at a residential highrise building in the city of Urumqi capital of the Xinjiang region triggered protests after videos of the incident posted on social media led to accusations that lockdowns were a factor in the blaze that killed 10 people  Urumqi officials abruptly held a news conference in the early hours of Saturday to deny COVID measures had hampered escape and rescue efforts Many of Urumqis 4 million residents have been under some of the countrys longest lockdowns barred from leaving their homes for as long as 100 days  On Sunday in Shanghai police kept a heavy presence on Wulumuqi Road which is named after Urumqi and where a candlelight vigil the day before turned into protests  We just want our basic human rights We cant leave our homes without getting a test It was the accident in Xinjiang that pushed people too far said a 26yearold protester in Shanghai who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter  The people here arent violent but the police are arresting them for no reason They tried to grab me but the people all around me grabbed my arms so hard and pulled me back so I could escape  By Sunday evening hundreds of people gathered in the area Some jostled with police trying to disperse them People held up blank sheets of paper as an expression of protest  A  witness saw police escorting people onto a bus which was later driven away through the crowd with a few dozen people on board  On Saturday the vigil in Shanghai for victims of the apartment fire turned into a protest against COVID curbs with the crowd chanting calls for lockdowns to be lifted  Down with the Chinese Communist Party down with Xi Jinping one large group chanted in the early hours of Sunday according to witnesses and videos posted on social media in a rare public protest against the countrys leadership  URUMQI BEIJING WUHAN  119 People hold white sheets of paper in protest over coronavirus disease COVID19 restrictions after a vigil for the victims of a fire in Urumqi as outbreaks of COVID19 continue in Beijing China November 27 2022 Thomas Peter 1 2 3 4 5  Thursdays fire in Urumqi was followed by crowds there taking to the street on Friday evening chanting End the lockdown and pumping their fists in the air according to unverified videos on social media  On Sunday a large crowd gathered in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu according to videos on social media where they also held up blank sheets of paper and chanted We dont want lifelong rulers We dont want emperors a reference to Xi who has scrapped presidential term limits  In the central city of Wuhan where the pandemic began three years ago videos on social media showed hundreds of residents take to the streets smashing through metal barricades overturning COVID testing tents and demanding an end to lockdowns  Other cities that have seen public dissent include Lanzhou in the northwest where residents on Saturday overturned COVID staff tents and smashed testing booths posts on social media showed Protesters said they were put under lockdown even though no one had tested positive  The videos could not be independently verified  At Beijings prestigious Tsinghua University on Sunday dozens of people held a peaceful protest against COVID restrictions during which they sang the national anthem according to images and videos posted on social media  ZEROCOVID  China has stuck with Xis zeroCOVID policy even as much of the world has lifted most restrictions While low by global standards Chinas case numbers have hit record highs for days with nearly 40000 new infections on Saturday prompting yet more lockdowns in cities across the country  Beijing has defended the policy as lifesaving and necessary to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system Officials have vowed to continue with it  Since Shanghais 25 million residents were put under a twomonth lockdown early this year Chinese authorities have sought to be more targeted in their COVID curbs an effort that has been challenged by the surge in infections as the country faces its first winter with the highly transmissible Omicron variant  RARE PROTESTS  Widespread public protest is rare in China where room for dissent has been all but eliminated under Xi forcing citizens mostly to vent their frustration on social media where they play catandmouse with censors  Frustration is boiling just over a month after Xi secured a third term at the helm of Chinas Communist Party  This will put serious pressure on the party to respond There is a good chance that one response will be repression and they will arrest and prosecute some protesters said Dan Mattingly assistant professor of political science at Yale University  Still he said the unrest is far from that seen in 1989 when protests culminated in the bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square  He added that as long as Xi had Chinas elite and the military on his side he would not face any meaningful risk to his grip on power  This weekend Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Ma Xingrui called for the region to step up security maintenance and curb the illegal violent rejection of COVIDprevention measures  Reporting by

       " {'guid': 16781, 'text_a': 'Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  That Donald Trump files frivolous lawsuits aimed at intimidating his critics and rallying his supporters is not something thats in any legitimate dispute Over and over his lawsuits have failed in court  particularly when the target has been election results or media companies Wp Get the full experience Choose your plan ArrowRight Last month a federal judge roundly rejected another of the former presidents lawsuits  this one against Hillary Clinton  labeling it a twohundredpage political manifesto rather than a serious claim The judge also cited the audacity of Plaintiffs legal theories and the manner in which they clearly contravene binding case law  So how does Trump respond to that Naturally by filing another audacious transparently political lawsuit that also seeks to disregard binding case law  Trumps latest lawsuit targets CNN which he wants to pay him 475 million for invoking Adolf Hitler in its coverage of him And perhaps even more than its predecessors this one should be understood for exactly what it is a personal grievance in search of an actual legal strategy In 2020 Trumps campaign also sued The  over opinion columns alleging that the campaign was connected to Russian electoral interference that case is pending A similar suit against the New York Times was dismissed last year  Advertisement  The lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and non sequiturs The argument effectively is that CNN invoking Hitler while talking about Trump  including calling his quest to overturn the 2020 election based on voterfraud falsehoods the big lie  automatically defames him  But to prove that claim the lawsuit leans heavily on random Twitter users who responded to CNNs work by making a much more direct comparison between Trump and Hitler than the network itself had  Trumps legal team contends that CNN must have known citing the big lie would infringe on Trumps rights because the networks new head Chris Licht reportedly said he didnt like the phrase But the report they cite from Fox News merely states Licht didnt like the phrase because it was imprecise and reflected language used by Democrats rather than because he worried about legal action The lawsuit also claims CNN anchors were explicitly instructed by Licht not to use the phrase but the Fox report says the opposite  that Licht did not issue a mandate or formal guidance to stop using the term  Advertisement  At another point when the lawsuit alleges CNN has been spreading propaganda it cites as proof that an NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll from 2019 found that 99 percent of CNN viewers believed that the Plaintiff lied about the Russia investigation But the poll didnt ask about Trump lying rather it asked about whether he had not been honest and truthful about it And the Mueller Report found that Trump had indeed not been honest and truthful  The lawsuit also cites CNN merely reporting on Democrats who compared Trump to Hitler saying such coverage is nothing more than selfserving pronouncements by political opponents of the Plaintiff and their news proxy and political participant CNN If reporting on such claims is defamation Fox News might want to watch out  But even beyond the odd and sometimes false presentation of the details the lawsuit advances a remarkably thin and novel legal theory that just begs a judge to dispatch it  Advertisement  First it argues that CNNs reporting meets the legal standard of actual malice set forth in the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v Sullivan That precedent requires plaintiffs to prove the statements made by the media were not only false and defamatory but that they were made either with the knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth  But just as quickly it argues that that standard shouldnt apply  In a footnote it says that that standard does not  and should not  apply where the media defendant is not publishing statements to foster debate critical thinking or the unfettered interchange of ideas but rather seeks to participate in the political arena by offering propaganda  The argument is apparently that CNN is not acting as a media organization so it should not benefit from the higher standard for legal damages in New York Times v Sullivan That would be a startling conclusion for a judge to make no matter what you think about CNN  Advertisement  With that out of the way Trumps lawyers proceed to argue that any comparison between a public official or political candidate and Hitler is defamation per se  that is that such comparisons are so damaging that they must be considered defamatory on their face  Being likened to Hitler is historically defamation per se as such a comparison tends to subject the target  and has subjected the Plaintiff  to hatred contempt distrust ridicule and even fear the comparison has had an adverse impact on the Plaintiffs reputation and political career it says It adds When a public official or political candidate is likened to Hitler it is defamation per se as the statement imputes a characteristic or condition incompatible with the proper exercise of that public office  Advertisement  As some noted when the lawsuit was filed this would effectively open up anyone who has ever compared a politician to Hitler to being sued Whats more that legal argument doesnt address the truthfulness of the statement What if the comparison was between an actual neoNazi and Hitler for example  The lawsuit ultimately does get around to citing actual court decisions in making its case It argues that the Hitler characterization is one that courts across jurisdictions have historically considered defamation per se  The evidence cited for this is bad  In a footnote Trumps legal team cites State v Guinn ODonnell v Philadelphia Record Co and Goodrich v Reporter Pub Co If you havent heard of these cases its because they are not federal ones They also all predate 1964s New York Times v Sullivan meaning the actual malice standard couldnt have been applied because it didnt yet exist  Advertisement  Whats more even these cases dont seem to apply to the case at hand As Akiva Cohen noted the last one dealt with a Texas newspaper which falsely stated that a local draft board had declared the plaintiff to be proNazi The second one dealt with a Philadelphia newspaper which stated that the plaintiff has broadcast his sympathy with most of Hitlers aims  such as  liquidation of Jews  In other words these cases turned on factual claims rather than just opinions or comparisons Trumps legal team though would like to argue that any likening of Trump and what Hitler did is illegal even if its obviously offered as an opinion and even if the comparison isnt as direct as it was in these cases  Oh and Trumps legal team would like the courts to ignore Supreme Court precedent to find in their favor  GiftOutline Gift

monitor the complex communications of an adversary nationstate from standoff distance rather than the simpler chatter of insurgents right below  Called ARTEMIS the plane uses its antennas and computers to intercept and decipher enemy communications The aircraft itself is made by Bombardier but the specialized modifications are made by Virginiabased defense and technology firm Leidos  These planes can see very far when operating at 40000 feet Mike Chagnon deputy group president of Leidos Defense Group said in an interview  Its the second Challenger 650 that Leidos has modified like this for the Army as part of a technology demonstration L3Harris Technologies are also developing similar business jet intelligence planes which it calls ARES  The Leidos and L3Harris planes are helping the Army figure out its longterm plans for new highflying intelligence planes an effort called High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System or HADES Those planes will replace the turboprops heavily used to survey the battlefields over Iraq and Afghanistan for insurgents and roadside bombs  They want a multilayer sensing capabilities from space to mud Chagnon said This is the airborne layer   was invited to see the Leidos aircraft shortly before it was put under the Armys control and agreed not to share the location of the planes home base The extra aircraft will allow the Army to deploy to different locations or participate in more exercises and experiments Chagnon said  In November 2021 the first ARTEMIS aircraft was pulled from an Army exercise in the United States and deployed to Europe to be part of the NATO effort to monitor Russian forces near the Ukraine border Over 10 days the plane flew from Arizona to Virginia where it received some upgrades before flying to Europe Chagnon said  It really hasnt been home since he said  As of Dec 1 the first plane has flown more than 370 missions racking up more than 3200 flight hours for combatant commanders around the world Leidos CEO Roger Krone said at the small turnover ceremony in the hangar  Youre flying basically ina mowthelawntype pattern for 10 hours and youre collecting massive amounts of data Chagnon said  The deployed aircraft flies an average of six days per week for nine to 10 hours per day Chagnon said The planes are unarmed and dont fly in socalled contested airspace thats defended by surfacetoair missiles and fighter jets  Were not going into the contested environment he said Were looking inside a contested environment from an altitude and a standoff whereas our counterinsurgency aircraft were flying in just looking down in an uncontested environment  As much as the aircraft represents a new generation of conflict it could also represent a new way of buying weapons  The planes are owned operated and maintained by Leidos employees not the Army But through satellites Army officials stateside are able to connect to the planes sensors remotely Chagnon said The Army essentially pays Leidos a bythehour fee  It benefits the government and it benefits the country Chagnon said Were responsible for keeping the aircraft in the air And they the Army no longer have to have that long logistics tail which is sometimes the most expensive part of a government program  They can turn the spigot off on these anytime they want he continued So were incentivized to continue to innovate on these planes and make them more useful andfind as many efficiencies as we can to keep the missioncapability rate high The first ARTEMIS plane took Leidos about 18 months from concept to delivery and the second is on track to be delivered ahead of schedule in just five months from contract signing Krone said  Krone several times noted that the company and the Army had put skin in the game to be able to buy and convert the business jets into militarized intelligence planes  This delivery is the culmination of a lot of really hard work and a lot of sharing of the risk he said  The technology is open so different types of sensors made by different companies can be installed Some of the sensors are governmentowned others purchased by Leidos  Leidos has also purchased two larger Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft that it intends to convert into intelligence planes for another Army spyjet competition called ATHENAR Its competing against an L3Harris and MAG Aerospace team and Sierra Nevada Those companies are also offering modified Global 6500 aircraft ATHENAR aircraft will also be owned and operated by contractors and will be a bridge to the HADES program  For Leidos a government contractor better known for its IT and government services ARTEMIS represents efforts to diversify its portfolio In 2020 the company purchased Alabamabased Dynetics a company that specializes in

Americans with long Covid also known as longhaul Covid postCovid or postacute Covid syndrome While definitions vary long Covid is at its core a chronic illness with symptoms that persist for months or years after a Covid infection Up to 30 of Americans who get Covid19 have developed longhaul symptoms affecting as many as 23 million Americans according to the US Department of Health and Human Services  Long Covid could be the next public health disaster  The country is about to enter its fourth calendar year of the coronavirus outbreak and new variants are expected to make for a tough winter Researchers think most Americans have had Covid19 at this point Studies suggest subsequent infections raise the chances of an adverse outcome including hospitalization and death The virus has killed more than 1 million Americans to date and some 2000 more die each week according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long Covid demonstrates that the virus is taking a lingering pervasive and perhaps even more insidious toll Medical experts have called it the next public health disaster in the making There are just large numbers of people affected by this said Dr Peter Hotez codirector of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Childrens Hospital and a dean at Baylor College of Medicine That number will only continue to grow as Covid19 continues to circulate HHS said in a recent report This could be gamechanging in terms of how we do medical practice in the same way HIVAIDs was a gamechanger Hotez said   one with a significant financial toll  But the tentacles of long Covid reach far beyond its medical impact from the labor gap to disability benefits life insurance household debt forfeit retirement savings and financial ruin This article is the first of a

prepandemic economic output said David Cutler an economist at Harvard University The aggregate cost rivals that of the Great Recession Cutler wrote in a July report Cutler revised the 37 trillion total upward by 11 trillion from an initial report in October 2020 due to the greater prevalence of long Covid than we had guessed at the time Even that revised estimate is conservative It is based on the 805 million confirmed US Covid cases at the time of the analysis and doesnt account for future caseloads Higher medical spending accounts for 528 billion of the total But lost earnings and reduced quality of life are other sinister trickledown effects which respectively cost Americans 997 billion and 22 trillion  Long Covid will be around long after the pandemic subsides impacting our

or selling their home to subsist Norpels 16year old son recently wondered if he should get a job to support the family but he doesnt even have a drivers license All of it is just very heartbreaking said Norpel adding that long Covid changed everything  What is long Covid It depends on who you ask  While there are still many unknowns about long Covid  shorthand for its scientific name postacute sequelae of Covid or PASC  what we do know so far is startling experts say Anyone whos had Covid19 can develop the condition People can get it regardless of the severity of their initial infection or the virus variant according to the World Health Organization It affects all age groups even those who were previously fit and healthy Studies suggest women are at higher risk than men one study found adult females to be twice as likely to have longhaul symptoms People of color are also more likely to get sick due to the increased likelihood of a Covid19 infection and less access to highquality health care its also more common in bisexual and trans people due to reduced care access and the stigma regarding their gender or sexuality the HHS said in an October report  watch now  However the medical community hasnt arrived at an exact definition of long Covid which complicates diagnosis and treatment The definition depends on who you ask right now said Dr Greg Vanichkachorn medical director of the Mayo Clinics Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program Here are some of the points on which opinions diverge Cause Doctors dont yet know what causes long Covid They have theories Perhaps its an autoimmune disorder like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis whereby the virus is gone but the immune system remains active attacking healthy cells by mistake or maybe small blood clots develop in the brain too small to cause a stroke but big enough to trigger neurologic issues Key symptoms Long Covid has been linked to more than 200 symptoms according to The Rockefeller Foundation Shortness of breath fatigue and sleep disorders or insomnia are the most common symptoms according to a recent global metaanalysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association a peerreviewed journal Others include anxiety depression body aches headache heart palpitations and brain fog  which describes challenges associated with cognition like thinking concentration communication comprehension memory and motor function Some sufferers have organ damage to the heart lungs kidneys skin and brain Duration Theres no consistent definition of how long symptoms must persist for someone to be considered a long Covid patient For example the CDC says a person has longhaul symptoms if they persist beyond or start after one month from an initial Covid19 infection The WHO generally uses a threemonth barometer Different health clinics may use others still What experts do know is that for some long Covid symptoms can last months or even years About 15 of people whose ailments persist three months after infection continued to experience symptoms at least 12 months after infection according to the metaanalysis Meredith Hurst a paralegal is one of those people Hurst caught Covid in November 2020 She was diagnosed with long Covid in December 2021 now two years after the initial infection she still hasnt recovered  The 42yearold who lives in Wilmington Delaware is unable to work and is in the process of filing for Social Security Disability Insurance  for which qualification is famously stringent Brain fog migraines and fatigue require her to complete the application in pieces all of her progress which had been saved in a draft was recently deleted because too many days had elapsed Meanwhile Hurst is struggling to make ends meet In addition to Medicaid health benefits she receives public assistance via food stamps Her credit cards are getting maxed out I dont know if its for the rest of my life or not Hurst said of feeling long Covid symptoms It will probably continue this way for me until there is a test a medication more research more education for the public for doctors she added This is going to be my experience for a while It doesnt mean forever Hurst said But for right now this is my reality  All sorts of testing to try for a diagnosis  The formal diagnosis code for long Covid used by researchers and physicians is only a year old The CDC authorized the code U099 in October 2021 An official diagnosis allows patients to more easily access long Covidrelated treatments file for disability insurance and request accommodations at work according to the HHS report Yet its nebulous nature means there isnt yet a definitive yesorno lab test for it Theres no diagnostic test said Dr Jeff Parsonnet an infectious disease physician who started the PostAcute COVID Syndrome clinic at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center Its really a clinical diagnosis Sometimes that process is straightforward a confirmed positive Covid19 test result with enough time passing after initial infection and persistent symptoms consistent with hundreds of other long Covid patients may be adequate Vanichkachorn of the Mayo Clinic said But often by the time Parsonnet sees patients at the PostAcute COVID Syndrome clinic theyve had all sorts of testing from a primary care doctor or specialists That might include pulmonary function tests or chest Xrays to look for heart or lung conditions for example magnetic resonance imaging MRI to identify brain inflammation or a tilt table test to evaluate a possible autonomic disorder Frustratingly for patients such testing often comes back negative according to medical experts even as it adds to their financial burden In many cases the diagnosis is long Covid because theres nothing else to explain the condition said Alice Burns associate director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at health care nonprofit The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation Its the diagnosis when all other diagnoses have been ruled out  There are a lot of physicians or care providers who are reluctant to apply a label they see as defined as everything but the kitchen sink Diana Güthe founder of Survivor Corps',

       " {'guid': 17153, 'text_a': 'A retirement bill that passed the House on Tuesday delivers valuable breaks for wealthy taxpayers while papering over longterm revenue losses  The Secure 20 Act which is not yet slated for a vote in the Senate pushes back the age at which the government can start taxing retirement accounts from 72 to 75 providing highincome earners an extra three years to defer tax payments and enjoy taxfree growth  To make up for the loss of revenue the plan uses what critics call an accounting trick  The Housepassed bill counts money collected by the government through taxes on Roth retirement accounts earlier to make up for the lost revenue on traditional accounts in the 10year budget window  However the change will add to the deficit unless a future Congress acts down the road  Its going to bring revenue in now because folks are paying tax immediately on contributions treated as Roth rather than being provided an immediate deduction on a traditional account but on the other side when you withdraw from a Roth that has earnings those earnings arent being taxed Garrett Watson an analyst at the Tax Foundation a rightleaning think tank said in an interview And so further down the line especially after the 10year budget window thats going to have a negative impact on revenue  With Roth IRAs people pay taxes when they contribute to their plans but nothing when they take out funds With traditional plans taxes are paid upon withdrawal so the switch under the new bill will lead to a shortterm boost in government revenue but a longterm loss  Assuming tax rates remain the same theres no difference in the amount of tax that is paid between Roth and traditional retirement plans only the timing as to when that tax is paid So using the new payment schedule to justify a tax cut and keep government revenue neutral over the next decade doesnt hold water critics say  One should immediately be skeptical of a provision where the giveaway has to be hidden has to be papered over by this accounting trick University of Chicago law professor Daniel Hemel said in an interview  While three extra years of taxfree growth may sound attractive to taxpayers the reality is that most Americans start using their retirement savings well before they turn 75 which means the exemption will be useful mostly for people who dont have to live off their retirement plans in old age  The vast majority of retirees take distributions at younger ages not because the law requires it but because they need the money to live on analyst Howard Gleckman of the leftleaning Tax Policy Center wrote in a March 24 brief  Another provision in the bill would increase the additional amount that older workers can deposit into their retirement plans to reap the tax benefits boosting the cap from 6500 to 10000  It goes without saying that those who can afford to make 10000 in additional contributions to their retirement plans have high incomes Gleckman wrote  Wall Street financial planners who make money in the form of fees levied on these plans are unsurprisingly cheerful at the prospect of having more capital under their control Lisa Featherngill a wealth planner at Comerica Bank described the provisions in the bill as really exciting in an interview with The Street  More than a dozen financial firms including Wall Street behemoth Blackrock which oversees more than 10 trillion in public pensions and other forms of institutional assets released statements endorsing the bill upon its passage in the House  The bill does include provisions that are geared toward middleincome taxpayers notably an autoenrollment mandate for employerbased retirement plans and an expansion of the savers tax credit a 1000 tax credit for low and moderate earners  Too many workers in this nation reach retirement age without the savings they need In fact about 50 percent of households are at risk of not having enough to maintain their living standards in retirement House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal DMass said on the House floor We need to do more to encourage workers to begin planning for retirement earlier  But the few middleclass encouragements like the ones passed in HR 2954 are a stalking horse analysts say for a longterm agenda of expanding subsidies available to highincome earners  Over the past 25 years legislation has repeatedly raised the statutory limits on contributions and benefits for retirement plans and IRAs delayed the start of required distributions and weakened statutory nondiscrimination rules  all to the benefit of affluent workers and the financialservices companies that collect assetbased fees from retirement savings Michael Doran a law professor at the University of Virginia wrote in an academic paper earlier this year  The result has been spectacular growth in the retirement accounts of higherincome earners but modest or even negative growth in the accounts of middleincome and lowerincome earners he wrote  Hemel of the University of Chicago offered a similar assessment on Twitter writing that the current bill contains just enough small potatoes for less wealthy taxpayers eg promotion of savers credit so that lawmakers can stand up  say they delivered for workers while actually being a deeply cynical deficitexpanding giveaway to highincome taxpayers disguised as a set of budgetneutral middleclass savings incentives  Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers dont see it this way casting the increased age requirements in the light of changing demographics and financial habits  It used to be 70 then it was moved to 72 now its been moved to 75 Rep Joseph Morelle DNY said after the House vote I think its just an indication of people living older I think the important thing here again is to try to have us as policymakers continue to try to have individuals be mindful of retirement needs  Rep Kevin Brady RTexas said in a statement that the new age requirements for distributions were especially important because many workers find themselves making more at the end of their careers and are open to focusing on retirement  The House vote could be a precursor to initiatives in the Senate where similar bills have support from both Democrats and Republicans A spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden DOre said that no time frame for a vote on retirement packages had been set yet and that the Senate would likely have its own markup  The House bill only had only five nay votes all from Republicans Reps Dan Bishop NC Andy Biggs Ariz Thomas

US District Judge John Sinatra Jr concluded that the rule part of a law that New York legislators passed after the Supreme Court overturned the states proper cause requirement for concealedcarry permits impermissibly infringes on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  Sinatras decision in Hardaway v Nigrelli comes two weeks after US District Judge Glenn T Suddaby issued a broader TRO against New Yorks law in Antonyuk v Hochul The two rulings do not bode well for politicians who try to defy the Supreme Courts June 23 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen by imposing new restrictions on the right to bear arms  The lead plaintiffs in Hardaway are the Rev Jimmie Hardaway Jr pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in Niagara Falls and Bishop Larry Boyd pastor of Open Praise Full Gospel Baptist Church in Buffalo They wish to exercise their fundamental individual right to bear arms in public for selfdefense by carrying concealed firearms on church property in case of confrontation to both themselves and their congregants  Hardaway and Boyd whose lawsuit was joined by the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation are licensed to carry concealed handguns and had consistently done so on church grounds as a safeguard against violent intruders But New Yorks lawwhich prohibits guns in myriad sensitive locations including churchesmade that precaution a Class E felony punishable by up to four years in prison  Under Bruen the state has the burden of showing that such locationspecific gun bans are consistent with this Nations historical tradition of firearm regulation which requires identifying analogous restrictions that have long been recognized as constitutional New York fails that test Sinatra writes The States exclusion is instead inconsistent with the Nations historical traditions impermissibly infringing on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  In the landmark 2008 case District of Columbia v Heller the Supreme Court described laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings as longstanding prohibitions But in Bruen the justices noted that the historical record yields relatively few 18th and 19thcentury sensitive places where weapons were altogether prohibited They included legislative assemblies polling places and courthouses  New York argued that laws enacted by four states Georgia Texas Virginia and Missouri and two territories Arizona and Oklahoma between 1870 and 1890 showed that its ban was consistent with the historical understanding of the right to bear arms   An 1870 Georgia law prohibited the carrying of pistols or revolvers in any place of public worship   An 1870 Texas law made it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine to bring firearms into any church or religious assembly That law did not apply to any person or persons whose duty it is to bear arms on such occasions in discharge of duties imposed by law   An 1877 Virginia law prescribed a fine for bringing a dangerous weapon to any place of worship during services It made an exception for anyone who had good  to carry a weapon in the necessary defense of his home person or property The same law made it illegal for someone to carry a weapon on Sunday at any place other than his own premises unless he had good and sufficient cause therefor   An 1883 Missouri law said anyone convicted of carrying a firearm into any church or place where people have assembled for religious worship could be punished by a fine of 25 to 200 andor five days to six months in jail   Under an 1889 Arizona law someone who carried a firearm into any church or religious assembly would face a fine of 50 to 500 plus confiscation of the weapon   An 1890 Oklahoma law made it illegal to carry a weapon into any church or religious assembly It included an exception for anyone whose duty it is to suppress breaches of the peace  As Sinatra sees it those examples do not meet the test established by Bruen Where a governmental practice has been open widespread and unchallenged since the early days of the Republic the Supreme Court said in that case the practice should guide our interpretation of an ambiguous constitutional provision But it added that to the extent later history contradicts what the text says the text controls because postratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text  The Court cautioned against giving evidence from the late 19th century too much weight Since postCivil War discussions of the right to keep and bear arms took place 75 years after the ratification of the Second Amendment they do not provide as much insight into its original meaning as earlier sources The justices also said territorial laws carry little weight because they appear more as passing regulatory efforts by notyetmature jurisdictions on the way to statehood rather than part of an enduring American tradition of state regulation  Sinatra does not think the analogs cited by New York establish such a tradition The state cites a handful of enactments in an attempt to meet its burden to demonstrate a tradition of accepted prohibitions of firearms in places of worship or religious observation he writes The notion of a tradition is the opposite of oneoffs outliers or novel enactments Rather tradition requires continuity  The six laws are of unknown duration Sinatra writes and the State has not met its burden to show endurance over time Hence the Court is left with a handful of seemingly spasmodic enactments involving a small minority of jurisdictions governing a small minority of population that were passed nearly a century after the Second Amendments ratification in 1791 Those outlier enactments Sinatra adds contrast with colonialera enactments that in fact mandated such carry at places of worship He concludes that the laws are far too remote far too anachronistic and very much outliers making them insufficient to establish an American tradition  Suddaby who concluded that New York had failed to justify many of its locationspecific gun bans was more impressed than Sinatra by the historical evidence regarding firearms in church Based on the historical analogues he wrote it is permissible for New York State to generally restrict concealed carry in any place of worship or religious observation But he noted that three of the six laws cited by New York included one or more of the following four exceptions 1 for those bound by duty to bear arms at the place of worship 2 for those possessing good and sufficient cause to carry a gun at the place of worship 3 for those serving as peace officers at the place of worship and 4 for those for whom the place of worship is his own premises  Taken together Suddaby said those provisions suggest that there also exists a tradition of permitting an exception to this prohibition for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship He also noted that the vast majority of the states in 1868 when the 14th Amendment which made the Second Amendment applicable to the states was ratified did not have this restriction at all Suddaby concluded that the Constitution demands that this provision contain an exception for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship or religious observation  That category presumably would include pastors such as Hardaway and Boyd as well as designated congregants Their concerns cannot be lightly dismissed given horrifying crimes such as the massacres at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs Texas  The plaintiffs motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction notes that the recent history of violence in churches particularly the murder of nine parishioners in Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 has reaffirmed Reverend Hardaways conviction to carry for selfdefense and to keep the peace at his church Since the Charleston shooting it says Hardaway has almost always carried a firearm for selfdefense on Sundays and at services until the effective date of the Place of Worship Ban  New York says that is now a felony The Nations history does not countenance such an incursion into the right to keep and bear arms across all places of worship across the state Sinatra writes The Constitution requires that individuals be permitted to use handguns for the core lawful purpose of selfdefense And it protects that right outside the home and in public Nothing in the Nations history or traditions presumptively closes the door on that right across every place of worship or religious observation  Although Sinatras ruling is limited to this one provision of New Yorks law he notes the perversity of the states response to Bruen Eight days after the Supreme Court struck down New Yorks unconstitutional proper cause requirement for concealedcarry licenses he writes the State responded with even more restrictive legislation barring all concealedcarry license holders from vast swaths of the State  That regulatory strategy has not fared well in the courts so far which has not stopped other states from copying it New Jersey and California are both considering bills that would ban firearms from a long list of sensitive places making it legally perilous even for someone with a carry permit to leave home with a gun', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

from the border with Russias ally Belarus for security reasons he said  Other manufacturers too are increasing production capacity and racing to hire workers companies and government officials from Poland Slovakia and the Czech Republic said  Immediately after Russias attack some eastern European militaries and manufacturers began emptying their warehouses of Sovietera weapons and ammunition that Ukrainians were familiar with as Kyiv waited for NATOstandard equipment from the West  As those stocks have dwindled arms makers have cranked up production of both older and modern equipment to keep supplies flowing The stream of weapons has helped Ukraine push back Russian forces and reclaim swathes of territory  Chwalek said PGZ would now produce 1000 portable Piorun manpad airdefence systems in 2023  not all for Ukraine compared to 600 in 2022 and 300 to 350 in previous years  The company which he said has also delivered artillery and mortar systems howitzers bulletproof vests small arms and ammunition to Ukraine is likely to surpass a prewar 2022 revenue target of 674 billion zlotys  Companies and officials who spoke to Reuters declined to give specific details of military supplies to Ukraine and some did not want to be identified citing security and commercial sensitivities  HISTORIC INDUSTRY  Eastern Europes arms industry dates back to the 19th Century when Czech Emil Skoda began manufacturing weapons for the AustroHungarian Empire  Under Communism huge factories in Czechoslovakia the Warsaw Pacts secondlargest weapons producer Poland and elsewhere in the region kept people employed turning out weapons for Cold War conflicts Moscow stoked around the world  The Czech Republic was one of the powerhouses of weapons exporters and we have the personnel material base and production lines needed to increase capacity its NATO Ambassador Jakub Landovsky told Reuters  This is a great chance for the Czechs to increase what we need after giving the Ukrainians the old Sovietera stocks This can show other countries we can be a reliable partner in the arms industry  The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and NATOs expansion into the region pushed companies to modernise but they can still quickly produce things like ammunition that fits the Soviet systems said Siemon Wezeman a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  Deliveries to Ukraine have included artillery rounds of Eastern calibres such as 152mm howitzer rounds and 122mm rockets not produced by Western companies officials and companies said  They said Ukraine had acquired weapons and equipment via donations from governments and direct commercial contracts between Kyiv and the manufacturers  NOT JUST BUSINESS  Eastern European countries support Ukraine substantially Christoph Trebesch a professor at the Kiel Institute said At the same time its an opportunity for them to build up their military production industry  Ukraine has received nearly 50 billion crowns 21 billion of weapons and equipment from Czech companies about 95 of which were commercial deliveries Czech Deputy Defence Minister Tomas Kopecny told Reuters Czech arms exports this year will be the highest since 1989 he said with many companies in the sector adding jobs and capacity  For the Czech defence industry the conflict in Ukraine and the assistance it provides is clearly a boost that we have not seen in the last 30 years Kopecny said  David Hac chief executive of Czech STV Group outlined to Reuters plans to add new production lines for smallcalibre ammunition and said it is considering expanding its largecalibre capability In a tight labour market the company is trying to poach workers from a slowing car industry he said  Defence sales helped the Czechoslovak Group which owns companies including Excalibur Army Tatra Trucks and Tatra Defence nearly double its firsthalf revenues from a year earlier to 138 billion crowns  The company is increasing production of both 155mm NATO and 152mm Eastern calibre rounds and refurbishing infantry fighting vehicles and Sovietera T72 tanks spokesman Andrej Cirtek told Reuters  He said supplying Ukraine was more than just good business  After the Russian aggression started our deliveries for Ukrainian army multiplied Cirtek said  The majority of the Czech population still remember times of a Russian occupation of our country before 1990 and we dont want to have Russian troops closer to our borders  1  45165 zlotys  1  233850 Czech crowns', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

explosiveladen drones although wreckage damaged five buildings without causing casualties  The attempted strikes underlined how vulnerable Ukraines capital remains to the regular Russian attacks that have devastated infrastructure and population centers in recent weeks mostly in the countrys east and south But they also highlighted Ukraines claims of increasing efficiency in intercepting drones and missiles and the possibility that Patriot missiles from the US may further boost defenses  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video the terrorists fired 13 Iranianmade drones and all were intercepted Such drones have been part of the firepower  along with rockets missiles mortars and artillery  that Russia uses to target power stations water facilities and other public utility equipment  ADVERTISEMENT  The snowcovered capital remained largely calm after the foiled attack which occurred around daybreak As the working day began authorities sounded the allclear  The head of the Kyiv city administration Serhii Popko wrote on Telegram that the attempted strikes came in two waves Wreckage from the intercepted drones damaged an administrative building and four residential buildings he said  A blast left the threestory tax office building in the central Shevchenkyvskyi district with a gaping hole in the roof and blew out windows in parked cars and in a neighboring building  Cleanup crews were on site quickly to shovel away the rubble and roll out plastic sheeting to cover the blownout windows in freezing temperatures One man unfazed pushed his son on a swingset at a nearby playground as the crews worked  Another parent Anton Rudikov said his family was sleeping when they heard an explosion and smashing windows Thank God the children were not affected beyond their fright said Rudkov whose daughters are 13 and 18 years old But why Russia would attack his neighborhood left him perplexed  I didnt do anything bad to them but it struck my house From where I dont understand why he said  ADVERTISEMENT  Residents told  reporters they saw fragments from a drone bearing the words For Ryazan The Kremlin claims Ukraine was responsible for a crossborder attack last week on a military base in the Ryazan region of western Russia  Ukrainian authorities have trumpeted their ability to knock down Russian weapons But strikes in some areas continue to cause deaths and havoc particularly close to the front lines in the east and south In the southern city of Odesa drone strikes temporarily shut off the power last week Kyiv has suffered comparatively little damage  More air defense help was apparently on the way US officials said Tuesday the United States was poised to approve sending a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine agreeing to an urgent Ukrainian request The Patriot would be the most advanced surfacetoair missile system the West has provided to Ukraine to help repel Russian aerial attacks since Russia invaded Feb 24  ADVERTISEMENT  The Russian Embassy in Washington said a Patriot missile delivery would be another provocative step by the administration which could lead to unpredictable consequences It added that this would cause colossal damage not only to RussianAmerican relations but would create additional global security risks  US officials said last week that Moscow has looked to Iran to resupply its military with drones and surfacetosurface missiles  The damage from Russian strikes has interrupted electricity heating and water supplies as winter approaches  Yet the UN migration agency said more than 5 million people who were displaced within or outside Ukraine since Russia invaded have returned The International Organization for Migration said a Nov 25Dec 5 phone survey of 2002 respondents in Ukraine found that only

regulations on THC legal marijuana products are leading to more medical emergencies  namely psychosis  and even death  photo compsite  With no regulations on THC legalized marijuana products are reportedly leading to more medical emergencies REUTERS  Laura Stacks son Johnny was driven into acute psychosis after years of highconcentrate THC usage Believing his dorm room was bugged and that he was being followed he jumped to his death at 19 Matt Pangman  Kyles now in recovery but his is a story that is becoming familiar to more and more American families Someone begins showing classic signs of hardcore drug addiction Eventually they suffer a full psychotic break But the only drug history is for cannabis  Were now counting 37 cannabisrelated diagnoses a day Dr Roneet Lev an addiction medicine doctor at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego said about emergency departments in San Diego County Its been steadily increasing over the years When I started in the 1990s there was no such thing Now I see 1 to 2 cases per shift The most common symptom is psychosis  We probably see 20 THCinduced psychoses for every amphetamineinduced psychosis said Ben Cort who runs a drug and alcohol treatment center in Colorado One study showed an increase of 24 in cases of psychoses in emergency departments in Colorado in the five years following marijuanas legalization in that state in 2012  Were now counting 37 cannabisrelated diagnoses a day  the most common symptom is psychosis said Dr Roneet Lev of emergency departments in San Diego Calif Tom Russo for NY Post  Since then legal marijuana has been transformed into a potent and unrecognizable product  When I speak at parent nights at schools most adults still think its like the weed we smoked when we were teens in the 80s which had between 3 to 5 THC per gram of flower said Laura Stack an advocate against cannabis abuse in Colorado We never had todays highpotency concentrates vapes or edibles  Lauras son Johnny was driven into acute psychosis by years of high concentrate THC usage He believed his dorm room was bugged and that the mob was after him  The THC levels in legal edibles and vaping products are not regulated and often contain incredibly high amounts AFP via Getty Images  Johnny killed himself in 2019 at the age of 19 by jumping off a sixstory building There are no caps on potency said Stack Theyre cultivating higher and higher concentrates of THC You literally cant buy what you could get in the 80s and 90s marijuana that mild isnt around anymore  THC Tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive chemical or cannabinoid that causes both the euphoria and the paranoia that tends to accompany marijuana highs The strongest marijuana flower you can buy is in the range of 25 THC  The edibles that are sold in dispensaries are created by chemically stripping the THC from the marijuana plant and creating a concentrated THC wax thats typically three times that level These products also lack CBD a chemical in natural marijuana that partially counteracts the THC Even more potent than edibles are dabs a form of THC that users smoke out of vape pens which can be over 90 THC At this level of potency THC can trigger severe symptoms of psychosis in regular users studies and addiction experts say  Stack became an advocate against cannabis abuse in Colorado after her sons death Matt Pangman  Now that THC is a more readily available drug and the perception of harm is at the lowest point in recorded history we treat more people for THC disorder than for opiate disorder right now said Cort Id say about half of our census is THC And the vast majority of them have THCinduced psychosis  One clinical study showed that a moderate dose of pure THC causes psychotic symptoms in about 40 of people who lack a family history of psychosis If youre a casual user and your dosage is mild that likely just means a touch of paranoia said neuroscientist Christine Miller an expert on psychotic disorders  Thirtyfive percent of people who have experienced such symptoms however will go on to experience a full psychotic break according to another study if they continue their high risk environmental exposure by continuing to use cannabis  Johnny killed himself in 2019 at the age of 19 by jumping off a sixstory building Vision Photography  According to multiple studies for those who have ever suffered a full cannabisinduced psychotic break the chance that if you still keep using youll eventually develop permanent schizophrenia is almost 50 percent Thats a higher conversion rate than amphetamines opioids or LSD  But what really makes THC more dangerous than those other drugs experts say is that so few people consider it dangerous at all We know fentanyl is bad We know meth is bad said Dr Libby Stuyt a recently retired addiction psychiatrist in Colorado We dont know that marijuana is bad  THC concentrates are highly physically addictive experts add It is almost impossible for people to quit said Stuyt  Dr Lev says about daily cannabisrelated diagnoses When I started in the 1990s there was no such thing Tom Russo for NY Post  But because theyre produced from marijuana many users assume that theyre as nonaddictive as an oldfashioned marijuana joint is According to a Rasmussen Reports poll 57 of Americans do not believe that marijuana is dangerous  Often cannabis users believe the THC products they consume are cures for the very symptoms that are generated by their withdrawal from the drug such as anxiety and insomnia People think Oh its my symptoms Thats why I need it Im anxious and its treating my anxiety said Stuyt No Its the withdrawal thats causing your anxiety  Because its allowed to be heavily marketed and advertised as medicine people believe its safe Stuyt continued Its the industry they keep saying its not addicting it doesnt cause psychosis This is no different from the tobacco companies when they were saying it doesnt cause cancer its nonaddicting  Stack became an advocate after her sons death Johnnys Ambassadors  Since marijuana has been legalized in 19 states and counting a 13 billion industry has emerged around it that has marketed the drug as a remedy for everything from chronic pain to anxiety The corporations that have invested most heavily in cannabis are the ones that know best how to market addictive products and manipulate public opinion into underestimating their risks the tobacco alcohol and pharmaceutical industries  There are in fact only four cannabisderived drugs that are FDAapproved Epidiolex for seizures Marinol and Syndros for nausea and anorexia and Cesamet also for nausea They are available only by prescription and none are sold overthecounter at dispensaries Since marijuana is still a Schedule I drug American scientists cannot legally research it President Biden has announced plans to review that status if the administration reschedules it researchers will be able to legally experiment with it and more medical applications could in time be revealed  Beyond those four prescription drugs evidence for claims to the medicinal properties of marijuana are scientifically lacking  This is not medicine Stuyt said This highpotency THC has not been studied as medicine  According to Cort Americans underestimate the risks of THC because they conflate it with the much less harmful marijuana of the prelegalization years Theyre not smoking weed said Cort Whats being consumed in these concentrates is devastating for their mental health  The whole world is telling them its safe

258 to 169 codifies protections for samesex and interracial marriages Every Democrat voted for it along with 39 Republicans One GOP member Rep Burgess Owens of Utah voted present  Advertisement  The measure passed the Senate late last month 6136  The bill actually lost GOP support compared to a previous version that passed the House over the summer Thursdays bill had stronger protections in it for religious freedom changes made by the Senate in an effort to win over more conservatives But for some reason  likely because people simply caved to strong pressure from conservative groups to oppose the bill altogether  the number of House Republicans who voted for Thursdays bill dropped from 47 to 39 compared to the vote on the first version  Curiously a number of GOP members changed their votes this time around  Republicans who previously voted to support the Respect for Marriage Act but opposed Thursdays bill were Reps Cliff Bentz Ore Mario DiazBalart Fla Brian Mast Fla Dan Meuser Pa Scott Perry Pa Maria Elvira Salazar Fla and Jeff Van Drew NJ  On the flip side two Republicans who previously opposed the Respect for Marriage Act supported Thursdays bill Reps Mike Gallagher Wis and Jaime Herrera Beutler Wash  Owens the lone present vote previously voted yes  And Reps Adam Kinzinger RIll and Lee Zeldin RNY who previously voted yes did not vote Thursday  Advertisement  The bill does two things It repeals the Defense of Marriage Act the 1996 federal law that banned samesex marriage and it requires states to recognize valid samesex marriages from other states It also ensures the same protections for interracial marriages  In one of her final acts as House speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif helped pass the Respect of Marriage Act a bill that codifies protections for samesex and interracial marriages Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images  Marriage equality is already the law of the land of course It has been since 2015 when in a landmark decision the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v Hodges that the Constitution guarantees samesex couples the right to marry  But Congress is pushing through this bill in direct response to the conservativeled Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade earlier this year destroying 50 years of precedent and some justices suggesting they should use the same rationale for overturning landmark decisions that have established the right to samesex and consensual relationships  Justice Clarence Thomas sounded the alarms when as the court overturned Roe v Wade in June he wrote in a concurring opinion In future cases we should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents including Griswold Lawrence and Obergefell  Advertisement  He was referring to the rights recognized in Griswold contraception Lawrence sexual conduct with a member of the same sex and Obergefell samesex marriage  Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito previously called for revisiting samesex couples constitutional right to marry too In October 2020 they said the Obergefell decision was undemocratic and that the court has created a problem that only it can fix  During Thursdays vote Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif said rightwing forces have set their sights on stripping LGBTQ couples from their right to marry  While his legal reasoning is twisted and unsound we must take Justice Thomas at his word and the hateful movement behind him at their word she said on the House floor in one of her final speeches as speaker Once signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act will help prevent rightwing extremists from upending the lives of loving couples traumatizing kids across the country and turning back the clock on hardwon progress  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested the court could use the same rationale it used for overturning Roe v Wade to overturn other cases relating to samesex marriage and the right to privacy Alex Wong via Getty Images  Advertisement  The reality is that without Obergefell in effect most states would have samesex marriage bans Thirtyfive states still have laws on the books whether in their constitutions state laws or both outlawing marriage equality  Put another way if todays Supreme Court overturned Obergefell the Respect for Marriage Act ensures that there is no federal ban in place that would invalidate hundreds of thousands of samesex marriages that have been legally carried out to date It also ensures that states with samesex marriage bans like Utah would still have to recognize samesex marriages performed in states with their own marriage equality laws such as Massachusetts  Rep Jim Jordan ROhio one of the bills critics said Thursday that he rejected previous claims by Rep Angie Craig DMinn that lawmakers not willing to protect interracial and samesex marriages are out of step with the American people  He backed up his argument by randomly attacking transgender people and abortion rights  The Democrats are the party who think men can use womens restrooms Jordan shouted The Democrats are the party who think boys can participate in girls sports The Democrats are the party that think you can take the life of an unborn child right up until their birthday  Minutes later Rep Sheila Jackson Lee DTexas asked Why are we here this morning  Were here because dignity should be part of life in America she said It is

government has issued directives and guidance to address cybersecurity across the digital ecosystem and lifecycle The White House and federal agencies have leaned forward to advance the cybersecurity posture of government and industry alike while keeping our most critical infrastructure secure resilient and operational  Across multiple administrations Congress has passed legislation and funding for key cybersecurity programs and capabilities Industry continues to invest in and advance cybersecurity tools and mitigation measures These steps signal a maturing collective national cyber defense and underscore the need for continued industrygovernment collaboration  A focus on infrastructure security and resilience  In April 2021 the Department of Energy DOE launched a publicprivate initiative to enhance the cybersecurity of electric utilities industrial control systems and the White House has followed up with a series of additional sectorspecific programs including one for the water sector as well as the recently announced chemical sector publicprivate cybersecurity initiative  The Transportation Security Administration TSA has also adopted the sectorspecific approach Following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack the agency coordinated with industry stakeholders and interagency partners to develop a series of security directives to support critical cybersecurity outcomes for pipeline operators The TSA also issued a pair of directives to passenger and freight railroad carriers which included requirements to employ defensive measures to mitigate cybersecurity threats early  This fall the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced its intent to develop rules for incentivebased rate treatments for voluntary cybersecurity investments by utilities including cybersecurity performance metrics Similarly the DOE released its National CyberInformed Engineering Strategy which calls for strengthened visibility of cyber threats in energy systems  Cyber risk as a business risk and national security imperative  The US Securities and Exchange Commission addressed cyber incident reporting and corporate board cybersecurity expertise in proposed rules earlier this year As the National Institute of Standards and Technology embarked on a planned update to its cornerstone Cybersecurity Framework CSF Commerce Deputy Secretary Don Graves identified managing cybersecurity risk as a part of doing business describing it as critical to our nations economic security  The federal government is also using the power of the purse to drive down cyber risk and move the needle on security across the digital ecosystem In September the Office of Management and Budget issued guidance to federal agencies requiring them to use software built through secure software practices And last month the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA issued the latest in a series of Binding Operational Directives It requires agencies to improve asset visibility and vulnerability detection and report that information via CISAs Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Federal Dashboard  Information sharing and industrygovernment

organizations to provide CISA with visibility into certain types of cybersecurity incidents and ransomware payments and requires CISA to return actionable insights  Last month CISA also issued Cybersecurity Performance Goals CPGs The voluntary crosssector goals establish a common set of fundamental cybersecurity practices for critical infrastructure aligned with existing frameworks including the NIST CSF  The CPGs are the beginning of sectorbysector conversations between industry and government on how to best manage cyber risk factors unique to each sector and to understand and communicate the security and economic costs of making security investments The CPGs and other recent guidance emphasize the critical need to build trust and transparency across government and the private sectors including both infrastructure owneroperators and the vendor community  A cohesive national investment approach  Previous directives dating back to the early days of the Department of Homeland Security established national policy to maintain resilient critical infrastructure and laid the foundation for current industrygovernment collaboration These current actions reaffirm

legislatures in any other era but in the era of Trump the case has taken on melodramatic proportions with liberal activists warning that nothing short of American democracy is at stake  Legal scholars are more circumspect though some echo the activists warnings that American elections could look markedly different if the justices side with North Carolina legislators and rule that state assemblies not state courts have the final say in how elections are conducted  This case is about checks and balances What kind of world is it where state legislators can do whatever they want when it comes to elections said Neal Katyal an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration who will argue against the North Carolina lawmakers What these folks are asking for is extraordinary and it would totally change the way elections are done  It aint American democracy he said  The case grew out of a dispute over North Carolinas congressional district map drawn after the 2020 census  A state court struck down the map drawn by the Republicancontrolled legislature as an illegal partisan gerrymander and imposed its own map  SEE ALSO Republicans criticize Trumps call to suspend Constitution in wake of Twitter revelations  Republican lawmakers said that ran afoul of the Constitutions elections clause which reads The Times Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations except as to the Places of chusing Senators  The Republican lawmakers say that language means state assemblies set final rules that state courts cant override  Opponents say that would upend the way elections are conducted  indeed repeatedly in 2020 when state courts and sometimes state administrative officials rewrote laws to expand voting access during the COVID19 pandemic  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered new deadlines for receiving mailin ballots The Georgia secretary of state responding to a lawsuit adopted new rules for validating absentee ballots  Although neither of those changes is part of the case before the justices they hint at what is at stake in the case over North Carolinas congressional districts  After state Republican lawmakers lost in lower courts they begged the Supreme Court to intervene and put the courtdrawn congressional map on hold The high court rejected that request earlier this year but sped the case onto its docket  SEE ALSO Rep Hakeem Jeffries says he supported certification of Trump as GOP paints him as election denier  Several of the justices dissented They said the Republican lawmakers claims had merit and their request for a stay should have been granted  We will have to resolve this question sooner or later and the sooner we do so the better wrote Justice Samuel A Alito Jr joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M Gorsuch  Justice Alito said that taking the elections clause at face value there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections  On the other side stands the Biden administration which joined liberal election groups and North Carolina officials in defending the states actions and urging the high court to leave things be  Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said a states usual checks and balances should apply and that usually means state courts have the right to step in and overturn a legislative decision when it is illegal or unconstitutional  Besides the opponents said North Carolinas legislature has explicitly granted its state courts the power to review congressional maps Even if the lawmakers are correct that the assembly has the final say it has fairly delegated that power to the courts  Common Cause the elections watchdog group Mr Katyal is representing in the case said a ruling in favor of the Republican lawmakers would give assemblies carte blanche to dictate how elections play out  As a matter of text structure history precedent and longestablished practice in this country that is flatly wrong The US Constitution does not grant impunity to a state legislature for violations of its state constitution simply because the legislation relates to congressional elections the group argued in its brief  Jason Snead executive director of the Honest Elections Project dismissed the threat to democracy rhetoric and said the real problem in 2020 was the use of lawsuits in state courts to try to change election practices for a partisan political objective  This is a case very fundamentally about what the elections clause says and which organ of state government is responsible for setting the rules

Devastating waves of COVID19  No one thinks this year will be anything like the last two dark pandemic winters at least when it comes to COVID19 But the country is now dealing with a different kind of threat  an uedictable confluence of old and new respiratory pathogens    Were facing an onslaught of three viruses  COVID RSV and influenza All simultaneously says Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Were calling this a tripledemic  Flu and RSV are back big time  The respiratory syncytial virus RSV began surging unseasonably early this year infecting babies and young children who had little or no immunity to that virus which wasnt circulating all that much over the past two years in part because of COVID19 precautions  The RSV resurgence is still flooding pediatric emergency rooms and intensive care units across the country Some parents are being forced to wait more than eight hours in emergency rooms for treatment for their very sick kids  Intensive care units are at or above capacity in every childrens hospital in the United States right now says Amy Knight president of the Childrens Hospital Association Its very very scary for parents  At the same time an unusually early and severe flu season is surging dominated by the H3N2 strain which often strikes kids and older people especially hard  Influenza has hit the southeastern United States Its moved into the Southwest Its going up the East Coast and into the Midwest with some ferocity Schaffner says  From coast to coast hospitalizations for the flu are at the highest level for this time of year in a decade according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Flu activity is high right now and continuing to increase says Lynnette Brammer an epidemiologist in the CDCs influenza division The good news is the vaccines this year are wellmatched to the viruses that are currently circulating and there is still time to get vaccinated  But now comes another Thanksgiving  These holiday celebrations with all their travel and their close contact usually function as virus accelerators Schaffner says Were spending a lot of time with each other Were laughing and breathing deeply And thats an ideal environment for these respiratory viruses to spread to others  What will COVID do this time  Of course COVID19 is still sickening tens of thousands and killing hundreds of people every day And new even more contagious omicron subvariants that are especially adept at infecting people  even if theyve been vaccinated or previously infected  are taking over    Theres a lot of moving parts here says Dr David Rubin whos been tracking the pandemic at the PolicyLab at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia  What is this all going to mean for COVID Are we going to see a JanuaryFebruary resurgence of COVID thats going to be fairly significant That may yet be coming  Many infectious disease specialists say the immunity people have from vaccinations and infections should keep any new surge of COVID19 infections from causing a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths  Im hopeful given where we are with COVID that were not looking at something like last winter But at the end of the day Mother Nature gets the final word on these things Dr Ashish Jha the White House COVID19 Coordinator told   Were in new territory here with three viruses all circulating at high levels simutaneously he says  I think its a really worrisome situation looking to the weeks coming ahead says Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist who runs the Pandemic Center at Brown University  Nuzzos worried because an exhausted nation has abandoned many of the precautions people were taking to protect themselves and others Flu vaccination rates are down by about 10 to 15 from previous years Only about 11 of those eligible for the new bivalent omicron boosters have gotten boosted  We cant just resign ourselves to assuming that its going to happen no matter what she says We can very much take action to prevent a rise in hospitalizations and deaths    Nuzzo and others experts say Americans can get vaccinated and boosted especially if they are at high risk because of their age or other health problems  People should consider Zooming for Thanksgiving if theyre sick testing for COVID19 before gatherings especially those involving older friends and relatives and other vulnerable people and even consider putting that mask back on as much as possible    If youre not eating or drinking its probably a smart idea to protect the immunocompromised the infants as well as the older individuals in the household says Dr Tina Tan an infectious disease specialist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine    There are hints that RSV may already be peaking and the flu could also peak early before any new COVID19 surge emerges That would help relieve at least some of the pressure on hospitals  Theres even a theoretical possibility that the flu and RSV could blunt any new COVID19 surge in the same way the coronavirus crowded out those viruses the last two years One possibility is a phenomenon known as viral interference which involves the presence of one virus reducing the risk of catching another  COVID could be outcompeted which is potentially good news Rubin says', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

the US Supreme Court will begin hearing two cases  one involving Harvard University and the other the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  challenging the constitutionality of raceconscious admissions policies  In the Harvard case the court will consider whether the school discriminated against Asian American students in the admissions process With UNC the court will consider whether the school is using raceconscious admissions in a limited enough manner  Race in admissions has been the subject of plenty of lawsuits  including at the Supreme Court level And if the court decides to

two very different admissions environments UNC is a state school that highly favors instate students its only allowed to admit 18 of firstyear students from out of state while Harvard is a highly selective private school that admits fewer than 5 of applicants thats just under 2000 students this fall  Affirmative action in admissions has been considered and reconsidered many times  Before that 2016 ruling in which the Supreme Court determined that the University of Texas use of race in admissions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause the court had already ruled several times on affirmative action  In 1978 the court ruled on a case involving a white man who was denied admission to medical school at the University of California Davis In that decision the court found race could be used as a factor in the admissions process but racial quotas were not allowed  Annelise Capossela for   Affirmative action hasnt always prevailed though In 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan law schools affirmative action policies but ruled that the schools undergraduate admissions officers couldnt use racial bonuses like extra points for Black Hispanic or Native American applicants on an admissions rating scale  Just a few years later in 2006 voters in Michigan approved an amendment to the state constitution that banned affirmative action programs in higher education  Michigan is one of eight states with such bans including California which banned the use of race in admissions in 1996 That state then attempted to reverse the ban through a ballot initiative in 2020 Voters chose to keep the ban in place  There are other ways to diversify student bodies  but they arent always as effective  Using race in admissions isnt the only way states and colleges have tried to diversify their incoming classes  After California banned raceconscious admissions in 1996 the proportions of Black and Latino students at the University of California Los Angeles fell drastically By 2006 a decade later only 96 Black students enrolled in a freshman class of nearly 5000 They became known as the Infamous 96  UCLA responded to those numbers by recrafting its admissions policies to take a more holistic approach considering several factors including whether students were the first in their family to go to college what high school they went to and their familys income  Annelise Capossela for   Other ideas include admitting a percentage of the states high school students like the University of Texas at Austin which automatically admits Texas students in the top 6 of their high school graduating class Lotteries have also been proposed where eligible students with high qualifications are randomly selected for acceptance  But so far researchers say none of the alternatives have been as effective as raceconscious admissions  Nothing is as good at helping to enroll a more racially equitable class than using race Nothing comes close to it says Baker at Southern Methodist University There are other tools Other ideas But if race is not taken into consideration those different types of techniques and tools do not replicate what raceconscious admissions policies do  Nothing is as good at helping to enroll a more racially equitable class than using race Nothing comes close to it  In two amicus briefs filed ahead of the HarvardUNC arguments at the Supreme Court the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley both admitted their efforts to meet their diversity goals without using race were falling short  But not every school says it is struggling to achieve diversity without raceconscious admissions The attorney general of Oklahoma filed a brief on behalf of several states in support of SFFA saying The University of Oklahoma for example remains just as diverse today if not more so than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012  Liliana Garces an education law professor at UT Austin says the debate over race in admissions is a reflection of the debate over race in America  Do we end and tackle racial discrimination by acknowledging the ways that it plays a role in our society and address those ways in higher education Garces asks Or do we just end racial discrimination by prohibiting institutions from considering race altogether Thats the misconception and the incorrect presumption that would only exacerbate those inequities  Garces joined more than 1200 social scientists in writing an amicus brief supporting Harvards admissions practices Preventing institutions from considering race she says it actually makes the situation worse  Other raceconscious efforts in education could also be at stake  There are nearly 4000 colleges and universities in the US and only a small portion  slightly more than 200  have highly selective admissions where fewer than 50 of applicants get in Thats just over 200 schools where a raceconscious admissions process could make a significant difference in who gets in  And yet despite how few students these policies would actually impact it matters a lot what the Harvards of the world do Tiffany Jones told  in 2019 when she was director of higher education policy at the Education Trust  We have to think beyond just the whogetsin and whogetstoenroll piece Dominique Baker explains This affects things like if there are any additional groups community events if there are additional scholarships in any sort of raceconscious policies that they could be on the chopping block based on these decisions  Baker wonders if a program designed to increase the number of black doctors  with support to complete the premed curriculum and get into medical school  could be called into question  Mitchell Chang who studies diversity in education at UCLA says thats what has happened in states that have banned raceconscious admissions by ballot measure Michigan California and Washington all moved to modify what were once more targeted raceconscious scholarships raceconscious programming raceconscious recruitment he says So it may have a much broader sweep in fact than just with admissions  I am deeply worried about the end of the use of race in any educational setting says OiYan Poon a visiting education professor at the University of Maryland College Park  She points to early court fillings from SFFA arguing any use of race or ethnicity in the educational setting is unconstitutional  not just in admissions  Will that mean the closure of Asian American cultural centers Poon wonders Will that mean the end of Native American studies on college campuses Will that mean the end of historically Black colleges and universities and the designations of minorityserving institutions  On Monday when oral arguments begin at the Supreme Court Poon will be listening from the court steps with her 7yearold daughter Shell be most attuned to the justices questions  to better understand the potential implications on colleges',

       " {'guid': 17913, 'text_a': 'Flu season is underway RSV is putting record numbers of children in hospitals And health professionals are gearing up for another Covid winter  With so many potential viruses in play it would be helpful if Americans had a way to distinguish between different ailments at home And when it comes to the flu in particular athome testing could help telehealth doctors decide when it makes sense to prescribe treatments like Tamiflu which need to be started within two days of onset of symptoms  Home flu testing would ensure that those who do need and receive antiviral medication for influenza are the ones who need it the most said Christina Yen an infectious diseases doctor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as well as ensure that we are making our treatment decisions based on data  advertisement  Yet no athome flu tests are available for purchase in the US Thats not for lack of technology  the rapid antigen flu tests at the doctors office are virtually identical to the Covid tests already in peoples homes according to Zoë McLaren associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who studies health policies for infectious disease epidemics  Rather the issue comes down to historical hangups  and the need to find digital fixes to address them  advertisement  Its really rare and its really new that people are allowed to know about whats happening inside their body without a physician in the middle said Michael Mina a former assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard  The Food and Drug Administration has been historically slow to approve overthecounter tests Mina said citing pregnancy tests as an example Although a 26yearold female product designer made a prototype of an athome version of a lab pregnancy test in 1967 athome pregnancy tests were not approved in the US until 1977 The general thinking was How could a woman possibly know what to do if she found out she was pregnant on her own without a doctor in the room That is a ridiculous concern because women have been doing that for millions of years said Mina  The FDA was similarly cautious with respect to athome testing for HIV which became the only overthecounter test for an infectious disease when it received approval in 2012  A 2016 FDA advisory panel meanwhile was split on whether the benefits of overthecounter influenza tests outweighed the risks Meeting transcripts show that as experts debated whether athome tests would actually be effective at keeping people at home if they knew they or their children had the flu one panelist joked that daycare centers might make the decision for parents if overthecounter tests were available  The woman is going to want to go to work and she wants to drop her kids off at daycare the panelist said The daycare when they sign their contract could say If your kid has symptoms were going to test him and send the child home if they tested positive  The room laughed at the idea  This scenario is not so laughable in the wake of the pandemic During the height of the Omicron wave nearly 1 in 4 symptomatic people were testing themselves at home Many Americans have clearly gotten accustomed to the idea of athome testing and to the fact that they may have to adjust their plans if they get a positive result  But regulators and clinicians still have concerns Athome tests can be less accurate than tests administered by a health care worker because people may not obtain enough sample to get a valid result or might have trouble reading the result correctly And whereas home users generally take a positive or negative result at face value clinicians have more context with which to interpret false positives or false negatives They might order a more sensitive test act with more caution for people they know are highrisk or decide to treat a patient anyway because they suspect a false negative  Theres also a historical concern about rapid influenza tests having low accuracy and varying in sensitivity from year to year Before 2009 measuring viruses by cell culture was the decadesold standard  but cell culture numbers could vary widely depending on how good the lab was at cultivating cells  During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic nucleic acid amplification tests such as PCR  which were much more consistent  became the new standard When compared against PCR methods rapidantigen flu tests now seemed much less reliable than they had been when their cellculturebased trials were first approved  Based on outcry from the medical community against rapid flu tests so inaccurate that some were only able to detect H1N1 in 11 of samples the FDA in 2017 reclassified antigen influenza tests from Class I devices to Class II which are considered to present more risk The FDA began requiring manufacturers to certify their tests against eight influenza strains which change from year to year depending on circulating variants These yeartoyear fluctuations can become a concern if people keep flu tests in their medicine cabinets and pull them out months or years later  There may be ways to address concerns about patients inaccurately administering and interpreting athome tests eMed where Mina is currently chief scientific officer is trying to address such issues by having a telehealth professional proctor each athome test the company sells  But while the eMed tests are marketed as athome flu and Covid tests the kits only contain a FlowFlex rapid Covid test Because there isnt an approved athome flu test clinicians cant ask the patient to test for flu like they would if they were in person Instead they follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for diagnosing flu through telehealth If the patient is Covidnegative during flu season for example they probably have the flu and clinicians might then decide to prescribe Tamiflu But this setup can prompt telehealth clinicians to overprescribe antivirals as Yen at UT Southwestern pointed out  This situation is particularly frustrating because there are rapid flu tests that are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendmentswaived meaning they are approved for use in pointofcare testing sites like pharmacies and health clinicsjust not at home  Its kind of like the FDA still lives in a world where the internet and telehealth doesnt exist said Mina There are ways to get people testing at home that dont require the person to be in charge of interpreting the results all on their own He imagines a scenario in which the FDA could broaden access to diagnostic tests by making telehealth appointments a CLIAwaived setting so that patients could swab their own noses under the guidance of a healthcare provider  Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine Please enter a valid email address Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if youre human  Whether the FDA would support that kind of change is unclear though a senior FDA official said that the agency is currently trying to find a better way to bridge pointofcare and athome approvals  The senior official also said that the administration strongly supports athome tests for respiratory viruses and has since before the pandemic But companies developing these tests have gotten a different impression from their interactions with the FDA Im glad to hear they said that said Wade Stevenson a senior vice president of marketing at rapidPCR test manufacturer Visby Medical  Stevenson acknowledged that the FDA has a hard job  theyre trying to safeguard the products available to the American medical system without stifling innovation When you put a new idea in front of the FDA generally theyre excited about it said Stevenson They like to see new ideas And they do not want to play the role of No this is never going to work They want to encourage development and people pushing boundaries  But manufacturers are frustrated about what they say is a lack of clarity surrounding the pathways to approval for overthecounter tests and constantly shifting goalposts  One obstacle manufacturers like Visby face is the question of what the FDA is looking for in the athome tests The FDA has strongly emphasized they want test manufacturers to engage with them by submitting presubmissions for feedback But Stevenson said that the FDAs guidance for their presubmissions came back too late to be useful for developing their clinical trials Clinical trials take a long time to complete because the prevalence of flu especially lowincidence influenza B has been so fickle the last few years  Stevenson thinks a Visby athome PCR test is a long ways away partially because the latest suggestions the company received from the FDA specified that the administration would like public health reporting to be built into athome tests This would help address the problem facing Covid tests today where the reported case counts dont include unreported athome tests But including this feature is not trivial because each e has its own reporting standards and different ways they collect that data  The FDA saying Think about this is nice and has good intentions said Stevenson but the reality is coming up with one product that does that today in an athome setting I dont know how to do that  Beyond getting tests approved its hard for test makers to transition into the athome market because insurance reimbursements dont typically cover athome tests whereas lab diagnostics are usually covered In 2020 Congress required insurers to cover Covid tests at no cost but that stipulation only lasts while the national public health emergency is in place And while athome tests are ostensibly meant to help lower barriers to access medical care CDC research shows that the people most likely to use an athome Covid test are highly educated in higher income brackets and white  meaning that if and when athome flu tests are approved theres more work to be done in ensuring they actually reach all populations  Currently the only test available for differentiating flu Covid and RSV at home is the Labcorp Pixel test where users swab themselves at home and send the sample in for lab testing However this tests turnaround time of one to two days wouldnt be able to compete with an athome test that gave results in 1530 minutes  Some Covid test manufacturers are now pivoting to include flu in their analytes Cue Health and Lucira Health have both filed emergency use authorizations for their Covid and flu athome tests both of which are molecularbased amplification tests and thus might sidestep some of the sensitivity concerns of antigen tests Both companies also have a companion app that can help connect patients to treatment options like Paxlovid or if approved for flu Tamiflu However neither have yet been approved by the FDA Luciras test which has been authorized in Canada and Europe was submitted for authorization in May while Cue Healths request was submitted at the end of September  We are in constant communication with the FDA said Debkishore Mitra founder and CTO of Lucira We are really hoping that we can make some impact in this

       " {'guid': 18047, 'text_a': 'The worst ideas in Congress never die they just get sneaked into unrelated bills This week that means lawmakers are reportedly trying to burrow a bad media protectionism bill into defense spending authorization Its called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act JCPA and its a doozy of bad incentives and state favoritism  In short the JCPA would suspend antitrust rules for publishers of online content so they could collectively negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the terms on which content may be distributed The latest version states that digital journalism providers can engage in joint negotiations with large tech platforms regarding the pricing terms and conditions by which the covered platform may access the content of the eligible digital journalism providers that are members of the joint negotiation entity It also sets up rules for these negotiations and mechanisms for enforcing their terms  The idea animating all this is allowing media companies to negotiate a link tax  As it stands search engines like Google and social media companies like Facebook that link to news articles tend to provide short snippets of these articles under their headlines This is a benefit to consumers who can get a better sense of what the article is about and to media companies Links to news articles on Google Facebook etc help alert people to articles they would potentially like to read and the small summaries entice people to click But in the fantasyland where Minnesota Democratic Sen Amy Klobuchar who sponsored the bill and other JCPA supporters live search and social companies will pay for the privilege of sending traffic to media entities  The plan utterly ignores the fact that search and social help online publishers find readers Instead it indulges a cartoonish rendering of tech companies as destroyers of journalism and possibly democracy  Of course its true that search and social platforms have eaten into the ad budgets of online publishers But the JCPA acts as if media companies are owed this revenue stream Far from preserving competition as the bills name implies it actually thwarts it by allowing lawmakers to pick winners online publishers and losers tech platforms  Its cronyism commented Jennifer Huddleston a lawyer for techindustry group NetChoice It provides a special government granted privilege that allows certain media outlets to collude and as a result risks making them more easily influenced by politicians who can take that privilege away    The JCPA fundamentally breaks the concept of the open internet where you can link anywhere you want for free and messes with copyright law in dangerous ways by implying a new right to demand a license for links or fair use snippets warned Techdirts Mike Masnick  So the JCPA is wrong on purely ethical grounds and also poses a danger to fair use to the open internet and to the free press Its also likely to backfire against online publishersand not just those who participate in negotiations  Meta the parent company of Facebook and Instagram says that if the JCPA passes it will stop allowing links to news websites altogethera move that could mean less web traffic for all sorts of media and as a result less ad revenue  If Congress passes an illconsidered journalism bill as part of national security legislation we will be forced to consider removing news from our platform altogether rather than submit to governmentmandated negotiations that unfairly disregard any value we provide to news outlets through increased traffic and subscriptions said Meta in a statement The Journalism and Competition Preservation Act fails to recognize the key fact publishers and broadcasters put their content on our platform themselves because it benefits their bottom linenot the other way around  Metas statement went to accuse the JCPA of creating a cartellike entity which requires one private company to subsidize other private entities saying that this creates a terrible precedent for all American businesses  If Google and other search engines have to pay to link to certain media websites it would only be natural for them to start downranking or even entirely excluding those websites There is no shortage of avenues where similar information can be foundnews aggregators perhaps or social platforms where people are summarizing news stories  Media outlets may find that instead of tech platforms paying them to link to their stories Facebook blocks their stories entirely and Google starts linking to Twitter threads instead  The JCPA has attracted a diverse range of detractors While the JCPA advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 157 vote last month moderates and progressives remain split on the bill noted Politico in October  Thats in part due to support from Republicans like Sen Ted CruzRTexas who successfully introduced an amendment that some fear will enable the spread of disinformation and hate speech Others have raised concerns that the bill could undermine copyright law and benefit large media outlets at the expense of small ones  leading to a strange coalition of tech lobbyists libertarian groups and progressive advocates lining up to oppose the legislation  Whether the JCPA could pass as a standalone measure is unclear So supporters are reportedly trying to stack the deck by slipping a version of the JCPA into an unrelated bill the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA  Supporters of the media bailout bill have secured the backing of Sen Jack Reed DRI chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee which oversees defense spending according to Breitbart  This brazen lastminute ploy by supporters of the media cartel bill follows what Politico predicted earlier this week having failed to secure a floor vote to the bill the JCPAs supporters now want to attach it to an entirely unrelated bill Should the NDAA route fail the bills supporters may also try to attach it to an omnibus spending bill another type of bill that is seen as a mustpass  A group of 26 organizationsincluding the American Civil Liberties Union the Center for Democracy and Technology the Niskanen Center the R Street Institute and the Electronic Frontier Foundationissued a letter yesterday urging lawmakers to not attach the JCPA to any pending legislation  The JCPA will compound some of the biggest issues in our information landscape and do little to enable the most promising new models to improve it the groups wrote before laying out specific issues they see with the bill Among these are that the JCPA sets a legal and political precedent that some uses of content that were once free of charge now require payment and that large media conglomerates

Jacobin looked at whether the Dobbs decision has reduced the number of abortions taking place in the US and by how much There are two main s to doubt that the overturnthenrestrict strategy of the antiabortion movement would make much of a dent in the number of abortions being conducted in the United States wrote Matt Breunig  The first  is that most of the population lives in states that are not likely to impose significant restrictions The Society for Family Planning data confirms this Prior to Dobbs 10 percent of US abortions occurred in states that went on to ban abortion 16 percent occurred in states that went on to significantly restrict abortion and the remaining 74 percent occurred in states that have not imposed significant restrictions The second  is that abortion seekers have three ways of getting an abortion 1 through a formal provider in their own state 2 through a formal provider in another state and 3 informally such as by acquiring mifepristone or misoprostol without a prescription Yet state laws can only really restrict the first option When that option is closed down many abortion seekers will opt for travel or informal methods The SFP data partially confirms that this is happening Between April and August of this year the number of abortions in states with bans or significant restrictions declined by 12500 per month while the number of abortions increased by 7140 in states without significant restrictions  Breunig noted that while this appears to be a reduction of 5360 abortions per month many of those 5360 missing abortions probably did occur through informal methods like abortion pills acquired without a prescription that escape this kind of tracking  QUICK HITS  Citing Covid DHS just announced enforcement of the REAL ID travel

US District Judge John Sinatra Jr concluded that the rule part of a law that New York legislators passed after the Supreme Court overturned the states proper cause requirement for concealedcarry permits impermissibly infringes on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  Sinatras decision in Hardaway v Nigrelli comes two weeks after US District Judge Glenn T Suddaby issued a broader TRO against New Yorks law in Antonyuk v Hochul The two rulings do not bode well for politicians who try to defy the Supreme Courts June 23 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen by imposing new restrictions on the right to bear arms  The lead plaintiffs in Hardaway are the Rev Jimmie Hardaway Jr pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in Niagara Falls and Bishop Larry Boyd pastor of Open Praise Full Gospel Baptist Church in Buffalo They wish to exercise their fundamental individual right to bear arms in public for selfdefense by carrying concealed firearms on church property in case of confrontation to both themselves and their congregants  Hardaway and Boyd whose lawsuit was joined by the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation are licensed to carry concealed handguns and had consistently done so on church grounds as a safeguard against violent intruders But New Yorks lawwhich prohibits guns in myriad sensitive locations including churchesmade that precaution a Class E felony punishable by up to four years in prison  Under Bruen the state has the burden of showing that such locationspecific gun bans are consistent with this Nations historical tradition of firearm regulation which requires identifying analogous restrictions that have long been recognized as constitutional New York fails that test Sinatra writes The States exclusion is instead inconsistent with the Nations historical traditions impermissibly infringing on the right to keep and bear arms in public for selfdefense  In the landmark 2008 case District of Columbia v Heller the Supreme Court described laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings as longstanding prohibitions But in Bruen the justices noted that the historical record yields relatively few 18th and 19thcentury sensitive places where weapons were altogether prohibited They included legislative assemblies polling places and courthouses  New York argued that laws enacted by four states Georgia Texas Virginia and Missouri and two territories Arizona and Oklahoma between 1870 and 1890 showed that its ban was consistent with the historical understanding of the right to bear arms   An 1870 Georgia law prohibited the carrying of pistols or revolvers in any place of public worship   An 1870 Texas law made it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine to bring firearms into any church or religious assembly That law did not apply to any person or persons whose duty it is to bear arms on such occasions in discharge of duties imposed by law   An 1877 Virginia law prescribed a fine for bringing a dangerous weapon to any place of worship during services It made an exception for anyone who had good  to carry a weapon in the necessary defense of his home person or property The same law made it illegal for someone to carry a weapon on Sunday at any place other than his own premises unless he had good and sufficient cause therefor   An 1883 Missouri law said anyone convicted of carrying a firearm into any church or place where people have assembled for religious worship could be punished by a fine of 25 to 200 andor five days to six months in jail   Under an 1889 Arizona law someone who carried a firearm into any church or religious assembly would face a fine of 50 to 500 plus confiscation of the weapon   An 1890 Oklahoma law made it illegal to carry a weapon into any church or religious assembly It included an exception for anyone whose duty it is to suppress breaches of the peace  As Sinatra sees it those examples do not meet the test established by Bruen Where a governmental practice has been open widespread and unchallenged since the early days of the Republic the Supreme Court said in that case the practice should guide our interpretation of an ambiguous constitutional provision But it added that to the extent later history contradicts what the text says the text controls because postratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text  The Court cautioned against giving evidence from the late 19th century too much weight Since postCivil War discussions of the right to keep and bear arms took place 75 years after the ratification of the Second Amendment they do not provide as much insight into its original meaning as earlier sources The justices also said territorial laws carry little weight because they appear more as passing regulatory efforts by notyetmature jurisdictions on the way to statehood rather than part of an enduring American tradition of state regulation  Sinatra does not think the analogs cited by New York establish such a tradition The state cites a handful of enactments in an attempt to meet its burden to demonstrate a tradition of accepted prohibitions of firearms in places of worship or religious observation he writes The notion of a tradition is the opposite of oneoffs outliers or novel enactments Rather tradition requires continuity  The six laws are of unknown duration Sinatra writes and the State has not met its burden to show endurance over time Hence the Court is left with a handful of seemingly spasmodic enactments involving a small minority of jurisdictions governing a small minority of population that were passed nearly a century after the Second Amendments ratification in 1791 Those outlier enactments Sinatra adds contrast with colonialera enactments that in fact mandated such carry at places of worship He concludes that the laws are far too remote far too anachronistic and very much outliers making them insufficient to establish an American tradition  Suddaby who concluded that New York had failed to justify many of its locationspecific gun bans was more impressed than Sinatra by the historical evidence regarding firearms in church Based on the historical analogues he wrote it is permissible for New York State to generally restrict concealed carry in any place of worship or religious observation But he noted that three of the six laws cited by New York included one or more of the following four exceptions 1 for those bound by duty to bear arms at the place of worship 2 for those possessing good and sufficient cause to carry a gun at the place of worship 3 for those serving as peace officers at the place of worship and 4 for those for whom the place of worship is his own premises  Taken together Suddaby said those provisions suggest that there also exists a tradition of permitting an exception to this prohibition for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship He also noted that the vast majority of the states in 1868 when the 14th Amendment which made the Second Amendment applicable to the states was ratified did not have this restriction at all Suddaby concluded that the Constitution demands that this provision contain an exception for those persons who have been tasked with the duty to keep the peace at the place of worship or religious observation  That category presumably would include pastors such as Hardaway and Boyd as well as designated congregants Their concerns cannot be lightly dismissed given horrifying crimes such as the massacres at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs Texas  The plaintiffs motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction notes that the recent history of violence in churches particularly the murder of nine parishioners in Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 has reaffirmed Reverend Hardaways conviction to carry for selfdefense and to keep the peace at his church Since the Charleston shooting it says Hardaway has almost always carried a firearm for selfdefense on Sundays and at services until the effective date of the Place of Worship Ban  New York says that is now a felony The Nations history does not countenance such an incursion into the right to keep and bear arms across all places of worship across the state Sinatra writes The Constitution requires that individuals be permitted to use handguns for the core lawful purpose of selfdefense And it protects that right outside the home and in public Nothing in the Nations history or traditions presumptively closes the door on that right across every place of worship or religious observation  Although Sinatras ruling is limited to this one provision of New Yorks law he notes the perversity of the states response to Bruen Eight days after the Supreme Court struck down New Yorks unconstitutional proper cause requirement for concealedcarry licenses he writes the State responded with even more restrictive legislation barring all concealedcarry license holders from vast swaths of the State  That regulatory strategy has not fared well in the courts so far which has not stopped other states from copying it New Jersey and California are both considering bills that would ban firearms from a long list of sensitive places making it legally perilous even for someone with a carry permit to leave home with a gun', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

approach to virus controls  leading to speculation that an end to zeroCovid may be in sight  Chinas most senior official in charge of its Covid response told health officials Wednesday that a new stage and mission in the pandemic response was due to the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant increasing vaccinations and the accumulating experience of fighting the virus according to state news agency Xinhua  Vice Premier Sun Chunlans comments  which made no mention of zeroCovid  came after anger over Beijings increasingly costly strategy of masstesting enforced quarantine and lockdowns brought thousands of protesters onto the streets of major cities  As their numbers swelled many also demanded greater political freedoms  and some even called for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping  Protests on such a large scale are highly unusual in China While demonstrations over local grievances occur periodically the protests are the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square prodemocracy movement of 1989  The Chinese government has cracked down swiftly deploying police at key protest sites calling protesters to warn them and tightening online censorship  Heres what we know  Whats behind the protests  The demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building  leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims  The city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home  Videos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday The following morning the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages  but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests  That failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets  Where have protests taken place  So far  has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities  including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai  In Shanghai on Saturday hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road named after the Xinjiang city to mourn the fire victims Many held up blank sheets of white paper  a symbolic protest against censorship  and chanted Need human rights need freedom  Some also shouted for Xi to step down and sang The Internationale a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century It was also sung during prodemocracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989  By Sunday evening mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing Chengdu Guangzhou and Wuhan where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions but more remarkably political freedoms Residents in some lockeddown neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets  Protests also took place on campuses including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing and Communication University of China Nanjing  In Hong Kong where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the citys Central district for a vigil Some held blank pieces of paper while others left

measures is underway and local governments should respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses in a timely manner  In a meeting with the NHC on Wednesday Sun also stated that a humancentered approach should be taken and China should enhance its diagnosis testing treatment and quarantine measures continue boosting vaccination rates  especially among elderly people  and strengthen medication and medical resources  Experts have previously said higher vaccination rates among the elderly was necessary before any potential relaxation of restrictions  Police form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27 Kevin FrayerGetty Images  At a State Council press briefing on Tuesday top health officials appeared to acknowledge the disruptions caused by measures such as lockdowns saying longterm closures can cause anxiety and life difficulties  NHC spokesperson Mi Feng said Covid policies were being rectified to include lifting lockdown as quickly as possible to reduce inconvenience  In recent days at least six cities across China including Beijing have made changes to their Covid policies in some cases lifting lockdowns easing quarantine requirements and eliminating mass testing according to staterun news agency Xinhua  Since Monday the number of locally transmitted Covid cases reported daily in China has been declining based on NHC data  Why are these protests significant  Public protest is exceedingly rare in China where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent wiped out much of civil society and built a hightech surveillance state  The mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused  A damning United Nations report in September described the regions invasive surveillance network with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans  China has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region  Protesters march in Beijing on November 27 Ng Han GuanAP  While protests do occur in China they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nations leader said Maria Repnikova an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media  This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues she said Instead this time the protests have expanded to include the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid19 lockdowns  There have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zeroCovid after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life  Isolated pockets of protest broke out in October with antizeroCovid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power  Earlier in November larger protests took place in Guangzhou with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets  How have authorities reacted  While protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering  Authorities in some cities have also adopted surveillance tactics such as those used in Xinjiang to intimidate those who demonstrated over the weekend  In what appeared to be the first official  albeit veiled  response to the protests Chinas domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to effectively maintain overall social stability  Without mentioning the demonstrations Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order Xinhua

Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday We continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest  UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told reporters the Chinese government should listen to the voices of its own people  when they are saying that they are not happy with the restrictions imposed upon them  The European Broadcasting Union also said on Monday that

media empire Fox News the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the New York Post and rightwing websites radiotalkshow hosts columnists and commentatorshave finally turned on Donald Trump Some are more direct and public in their criticisms of the former president than others but without question something fundamental has changed  The GOP establishment is angry at Trump who announced his bid for reelection on November 15 for recently hosting a prominent white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and an antiSemite Ye the rapper formerly known as Kanye West for dinner For embracing QAnon For advocating for the termination of the Constitution For trashing the Supreme Court on which three of his nominees sit For promising to look very very favorably at pardoning January 6 insurrectionists if hes reelected And for being embroiled in multiple criminal investigations  But mostly they are angry at Trump for costing them seats in the House and control of the Senate This midterm election was the third straight election cycle in which Republicans under Trumps leadership and in his shadow suffered setbacks They stood by as he handpicked terrible candidates and obsessively promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 electionand they suffered the consequences  Scott Reed a veteran Republican strategist and a former top adviser to the US Chamber of Commerce told The New York Times that the past several weeks have been devastating for Trumps future viability  Abandonment has begun Reed said  Whether the damage Trump has sustained is enough to keep him from winning the 2024 nomination is impossible to know at this point Although the erosion in his support is significant a large part of the base has shown sustained loyalty to Trump  So how should those of us who for years have repeatedly warned Republicans about Trump view those who have finally done an aboutface in some cases mimicking the very criticisms that Never Trumpers have been making since the start of the Trump era  David Frum What the Never Trumpers want now  We ought to welcome their turnabout This is after all what many of us have been urging them to do Everyone makes mistakes and everyone should have the chance to correct those mistakes including onetime Trump enthusiasts Just as important purging Trump from Americas political landscape can only happen if the Republican Party first purges him from its ranks If people who once supported Trump are at last willing to cast him aside that is all to the good  But we shouldnt see a moral awakening where there is none The reason many longtime Trump supporters are deserting him is because they believe he is a loser and an impediment to their quest for power They are tossing Trump overboard because hes no longer useful to them Their considerations are practical rather than principled and precisely because the shift is for unprincipled reasons we should assume that if they calculate that Trump can win againand certainly if hes the Republican nominee in 2024they will once again rally around him  Nor are the belated resisters honestly reckoning with their recent proTrump past They are instead engaging in a series of rationalizations to explain why they enabled and championed this loathsome figure for so long  Some have simply chosen to forget their role in Trumps rise Some are eager to portray themselves as having been far more critical of Trump than they actually were Some prefer to turn the tables and go on the offensive chiding longtime critics of Trump for not forgiving and forgetting And still others are peddling a narrative in which Trump is only now spinning out of control Since the midterms were told something has snapped Trump has apparently lost touch with reality These people feign shock at what the man in MaraLago has become Who could possibly have seen this coming  All of this maneuvering is born out of a natural desire to escape moral accountability protect their reputation and not admit their mistakes and an even more intense desire to refuse to admit that Never Trumpers whom they view with contempt might have been right all along Their psychological defense mechanismsrationalizations intended to prevent feelings of guilt shame or discomfort about actions that on some level they know were wrong or unwiseare preventing them from coming to grips with their catastrophic misjudgments  Context is important here Were not talking about a mistaken assessment of the effects that tariffs might have on prices for consumers were talking about a party that nominated and at every turn defended a uniquely malicious figure in American politics And he didnt come disguised as anything other than what he was Trump was a wolf in wolfs clothing  Trumps dinner with Fuentes and Ye was not a break with the past Rather it exists on a long continuum of wrongdoing making hushmoney payments to porn stars committing tax fraud and falsifying records pathological lying cruelty and political brutality siding with the intelligence agencies of Americas enemies rather than Americas complimenting savage dictators and blackmailing our allies in order to dig up dirt on political opponents demagoguery borderless corruption and calls for political violence obstructing justice abusing the pardon power and wanting the IRS to investigate political foes racist taunts and appeals to Americans ugliest instincts lighting the flame that ignited a mob that stormed the Capitol ignoring pleas for help during the insurrection encouraging those who wanted to hang his vice president and trying to overthrow the election  Read The GOP cant hide from extremism  At no point did Trump deceive Republicans into supporting him he simply broke them Formerly fierce critics such as Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham became lapdogs Republicans didnt change Trump he changed them Fundamental convictions or at least what had been sold as fundamental convictions were inverted Character in leaders used to matter we were tolduntil depravity became acceptable and even fashionable  As Trump descends further into madness its in the interests of Republicans to bury this record of iniquityto move on as if it were all some kind of surreal dream in the words of Andrew Sullivan But it wasnt a dream The trauma of the Trump years and the role of those who made them possible cant be papered over forgotten or pushed down what George Orwell called memory holes Individuals who allowed a man with fascist instincts into the Oval Office and once he was there provided him cover owe their fellow citizensand themselvesan honest accounting  Doing this would begin to repair one of the most damaging aspects of the Trump years which was his and his supporters gaslighting of America their nonstop dawntodusk assault on facts and truth their attempt to distort reality to fit their narrative The Republican establishment that stood with Trump may now want to break with him but in the process they are still relying on some bad habits including inviting the rest of us into their hall of mirrors  Trump supporters have deformed history and reality quite enough Even as we welcome them to the resistance we ought to expect from them an acknowledgment of the role they played in the rise and rule of Donald Trump  At some point all of us even the GOP will move on from Trump That process is hopefully well under way Healing our nation will require different things from different sides including some measure of civic grace and some measure of civic honesty Other nations more divided

gaping trust gap with Africa  one that has grown wider over years of frustration about Americas commitment to the continent  In the leadup to the threeday USAfrica Leaders Summit that begins Tuesday Biden administration officials played down their increasing concern about the clout of China and Russia in Africa which is home to more than 13 billion people Instead administration officials tried to put the focus on their efforts to improve cooperation with African leaders  This summit is an opportunity to deepen the many partnerships we have on the African continent White House press secretary Karine JeanPierre said when asked about the shadow that China and Russia cast on the meetings We will focus on our efforts to strengthen these partnerships across a wide range of sectors spanning from businesses to health to peace and security but our focus will be on Africa next week  ADVERTISEMENT  To that end White House officials said that major deliverables and initiatives  diplomatic speak for big announcements  will be peppered throughout the meetings The White House previewed one major summit announcement on Friday saying that Biden would use the gathering to declare his support for adding the African Union as a permanent member of the Group of 20 nations  The summit will be the biggest international gathering in Washington since before the start of the COVID19 pandemic Local officials are warning residents to brace for road blocks and intensified security as 49 invited heads of states and leaders  and Biden  whiz around the city  Talks are expected to center on the coronavirus climate change the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on Africa trade and more according to White House officials Biden is set to deliver remarks at a USAfrica business forum hold small

eight years ago by President Barack Obama  Biden has an opportunity to assuage concerns in Africa about whether the US is serious about tending to the relationship  ADVERTISEMENT  Bidens effort to draw African nations closer to the US comes at a complicated moment as his administration has made plain that it believes that Chinese and Russian activity in Africa is a serious concern to US and African interests  In its subSaharan Africa strategy unveiled in August the Biden administration warned that China which has pumped billions into African energy infrastructure and other projects sees the region as an arena where Beijing can challenge the rulesbased international order advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests undermine transparency and openness  ADVERTISEMENT  The administration also argues that Russia the preeminent arms dealer in Africa views the continent as a permissive environment for Kremlinconnected oligarchs and private military companies to focus on fomenting instability for their own strategic and financial benefit  Still administration officials are emphasizing that concerns about China and Russia will not be central to the talks  The United States prioritizes our relationship with Africa for the sake of our mutual interests and our partnership in dealing with global challenges Molly Phee assistant secretary of state for African affairs told reporters before the summit We are very conscious again of the Cold War history were conscious again of the deleterious impact of colonialism on Africa and we studiously seek to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of those earlier eras  The administration has been disappointed that much of the continent has declined to follow the US in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine but Biden is not expected to dwell on differences publicly  ADVERTISEMENT  The president is expected to participate with leaders in a session on promoting food security and food systems resilience Africa has been

collateral damage that the Russian war has inflicted on Africa in terms of food supply and the diversion of development assistance to Ukraine The opportunity costs of the invasion have been very high in Africa said John Stremlau a visiting professor of international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg  Four countries that were suspended from the African Union  Guinea Sudan Mali and Burkina Faso were not invited to the summit because coups in those nations led to unconstitutional changes in power The White House also did not invite the East African nation of Eritrea Washington does not have full diplomatic relations with the country  ADVERTISEMENT  Bidens decision to invite several leaders to the summit who have questionable records on human rights and democracy is looming large ahead of the gathering  Equatorial Guinea was invited despite the State Department stating that it held serious doubts about last months election in the tiny Central African nation Opposition parties made credible allegations of significant electionrelated irregularities including documented instances of fraud intimidation and coercion according to the department Election officials reported that President Teodoro Obiangs ruling party won nearly 95 of the vote  Zimbabwe which has faced years of US and Western sanctions over poor governance human rights abuses and widespread corruption also was invited  President Emmerson Mnangagwa who seized power from longtime ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017 has sought to cast himself as a reformer but local and international human rights campaigners accuse him of repression that is just as bad or even worse than Mugabes  Although Mnangagwa enjoys cozy relations with China and Russia as did Mugabe he has also sought to make friends with the US and other Western countries in an effort to bolster his legitimacy  In a national address that he delivered in November in a new Chinesegifted multimilliondollar parliament building Mnangagwa held out the invitation to the USAfrica summit as a sign of his administrations success He said the southern African country welcomed the invitation but he also called for the unconditional removal of sanctions that he blames for Zimbabwes debilitating economic woes  Emphasis remains on dialogue Mnangagwa said  Ethiopia received an invitation even though Biden late last last year announced he was cutting out the country from a US trade program known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act over Ethiopias failure to end a war in the Tigray region that led to gross violations of human rights A peace deal was signed last month but implementation faces major challenges such as the continued presence of troops from neighboring Eritrea  Analysts say that African leaders will be looking for Biden to make some major commitments during the summit including announcing his first presidential visit to subSaharan Africa efforts to bolster the continents economy through private sector investment and trade and more  Perhaps most importantly it could be an opportunity for Biden to demonstrate that Africa is more than a battleground in its economic and military competition with Beijing and Moscow  I do strongly believe that the United States is still seen as a superpower from the African perspective but most African leaders do not want to align with its promotion of democracy said Abraham Kuol Nyuon a political analyst and associate professor of political science at the University of Juba in South Sudan They need the support of America but not the system of America    Mutsaka reported from Harare Zimbabwe and Magome from Johannesburg  writers Cara Anna in Nairobi Kenya and Matthew Lee contributed to this report', 'text_b': None, 'label':

UK taxpayers money went to the CCG with a stated goal of fighting corruption in schools according to details the UK published in the International Aid Transparency Initiative IATI data standard This was a fraction of a large government fund to support civil society in Ghana which was managed by a UK charity Christian Aid and that ended in 2020 It is typical for development assistance to be disbursed by donor governments to for and nonprofit organizations which act as intermediaries redistributing aid to their partners in recipient countries  The US federal government sent more than 13000 to the CCG in January 2020 IATI records show for a project to provide shelters to refugees at Krisan Camp in southwestern Ghana  In addition 208000 euros about 245000 of German aid money went to the CCG between 2014 and 2018 via an intermediary called Brot für die Welt a spokesperson for the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development told  Government funding ended in May 2018 but Brot für die Welt continued cooperation with the CCG for almost three more years  until another antiLGBTQI statement to the press in February 2021 that clearly positioned the CCG against LGBTQI according to s communication with the spokesperson  German as well as Italian aid also went to development projects run by or benefiting some individual CCG member churches that have spoken against LGBTQI rights  has identified Projects of Ghanas Methodist Evangelical Presbyterian and Presbyterian churches received at least 670000 from these countries via intermediary religious NGOs between 2016 and 2020 according to the most recent available aid data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD corroborated by correspondence with the donor countries  During that same period an Evangelical Presbyterian churchs director told local media that his church would continue to be loud and clear in condemning attemptsto encourage homosexuality No amount of aid promised by the developed world should make Ghana adopt that abominable act he said  Germany Italy and the US have also funded projects by or benefiting the Ghanaian Catholic Church  German Catholic intermediary NGO Misereor disclosed spending 28 million euros 31 million of German taxpayers money on projects by the Catholic Churchs partner organizations in Ghana between 2016 and 2020 This included 127000 that was spent on a project with a broad goal of strengthening strategy and management standards for the churches development work  Aid benefiting Ghanas Catholic Church also included 850000 from the US Between 2019 and 2020 this money went to Ghanaian and US contractors for a project whose goal was to transition several dioceses of the Church to solar power as confirmed by the US Trade and Development Agency USTDA  Yet during that period the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference issued a joint statement with the CCG opposing samesex unions In 2019 the president of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference called being LGBTQI a lifestyle that is against universal natural values and certainly against Ghanaian cultural and moral values He urged the countrys president to block the introduction of evil agenda in schools meaning comprehensive sex education including teachings about LGBTQI rights  attempted to reach Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference several times for the written story and received no response To the request for television interview  was informed that the President is the official spokesperson of the Conference but that he would not be available to grant the interview  The CCG and none of the churches in this story responded to s multiple requests for comment The spokesperson for the National Coalition for Proper Human Sexual Rights and Family Values FohAmoaning also declined to answer questions  Criminalizing samesex relationships in Ghana  Samesex relationships were first criminalized in Ghana in the 19th century under British colonial rule In 2018 the UK prime minister at the time Theresa May apologized for such laws  saying they were wrong then and they are wrong now  In 1960 homosexual acts were made illegal in Ghanas first postindependence criminal code which replaced colonialera laws but was still influenced by them This part of the law however was rarely enforced  In its current form the new bill brought forth by eight MPs in July 2021 proposes to criminalize not only samesex sexual relationships and marriages but also identifying as LGBTQI promoting and funding of LGBTQI groups and public debate or education on sexual orientation and gender identity In addition if the bill were to pass it would impose medical assistance on persons questioning their sexuality and on intersex children  The bill drew sharp local and international criticism Soon after it came before Ghanas parliament UN human rights experts called it a recipe for conflict and violence that would mandate deeply harmful practices that amount to illtreatment and are conducive to torture including corrective rape for women  A global LGBTQI rights group OutRight Action International recently warned that the bill goes much further than any antiLGBTQI law anywhere in the world  The organization said the bill has contributed to an increasingly hostile climate and cited mob attacks physical violence arbitrary arrests blackmail and online harassment verbal harassment gang rape and other abuses reported by LGBTQI Ghanaians  Ghanas parliament in session  Leila Yahaya executive director of queer Muslim organization One Love Sisters Ghana told  how police raided the paralegal training session her group had organized for activists in the city of Ho leading to the arrest of 21 people including herself  The activists were charged with unlawful assembly and detained for over three weeks until the case was dismissed for lack of evidence  Many of those arrested lost their jobs and were ostracized by family members as a result said Yahaya who received a death threat and was told she needed a real man in her life on social media I didnt talk to anybody for more than six months I was still in my shell trying to recover and pick up the pieces of my life she said  Yahaya told  she felt the introduction of the antiLGBTQI bill was trying to erase her whole existence as a human being  Your whole life is full of question marks What if its passed What if its not Yahaya said adding she particularly fears for fellow queer people who may not know their rights as citizens or how to keep themselves safe  Another LGBTQI activist who received threats for his work is AbdulWadud Mohammed communications director at LGBT Rights Ghana In January 2021 his organization had opened an LGBTQI community center in Accra but after just a month in operation it was raided by Ghanaian security forces and shut down following calls from religious leaders including the CCG and Catholic bishops  for this to happen  Mohammed said he had to go into hiding for several months to avoid persecution moving from one house to another with a group of fellow activists until he moved abroad to study  Why do Ghanaian churches get foreign aid  While Ghana is a nominally secular country faithbased organizations wield significant influence on life and politics  With about 71 of Ghanas population identifying as Christian churches are  in every village  so international development and humanitarian organizations have long recognized the need to work with religious groups Ghanas president Nana AkufoAddo himself acknowledged in a 2018 speech that the church can be very influential in Ghana  he then sought to reassure church leaders that his office had no authority to allow samesex marriages  We must acknowledge that over the years many mission churches and African indigenous churches have been involved in development work such as building primary schools developing wells formal and informal education hospitals and clinics professor of gender studies and African studies at the University of Ghana Akosua Adomako Ampofo told   She added that while it is not fair to paint all churches with a broad brush some have adopted a more restricted understanding of gender and sexuality which she sees as problematic Within churches some peoples understanding of the Gospel seems to have led them to believe that if there is a disagreement between the way they understand Christianity and other peoples lives then they have the right to impose their view because they see that as the right view  LGBT Rights Ghana communications director Mohammed echoed this view telling  I understand why they churches are getting this money Donors expect results  and one of the entities that can show results is the church because they are seen as people that are helping the community  It becomes disturbing when this very same aid can be used indirectly against marginalized communities Mohammed added  Im mad because these churches are not hiding the fact that they are homophobic  Asibi a pseudonym is used to protect her identity has experienced firsthand the increasingly hostile climate members of Ghanas LGBTQI community face  She had been volunteering to help set up the LGBTQI community center in Accra before it was raided Local TV channels broadcast videos from the centers YouTube page and Asibi believes that visibility put her at risk  According to the 25yearold she suspects that a family member took screenshots of her social media accounts  which she used to connect with the queer community  and shared them with other family members Some relatives then called her mother At this point Asibi who is estranged from her family began to worry  One night in her studio flat she thought that she could hear someone trying to open a window from the outside The next day a neighbor told her that a man  who she suspects was a family member  had come by with four others Asibi immediately went inside packed a bag and left her neighborhood She stayed with different friends for months until she got a visa and fled the country  There are many others with stories of intimidation or violence who didnt want to go on the record And yet churches continue to push for harsher treatment by the law Earlier this year for example a Presbyterian Church representative reportedly told a parliamentary hearing on the bill that the current criminal code is inadequate and called for a minimum of three years in jail for any offense committed under the bill to serve as deterrent for people who harbor similar intent  I am mad because these churches are not hiding the fact that they are homophobic Asibi told  I dont get the justification for funding churches It further erodes my trust that these international bodies are truly interested in safeguarding the rights of marginalized groups in Ghana  What Western donors had to say  When presented with s findings a spokesperson for Germanys Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development BMZ told  that the country is aware of the human rights situation of LGBTQI persons in Ghana and that its intermediary NGOs do not support any projects which endanger the rights of LGBTQI communities These intermediaries the spokesperson added are now seeking to distance themselves from statements made and opinions expressed by the Christian Council of Ghana CCG  However  learned that the NGO intermediary Brot für die Welt continues to support projects run by individual CCG members Those projects are a threeyear grant worth 32000 for the Methodist Agricultural Program approved in 2021 a vocational training program by the Presbyterian Church of Ghana which received 460000 last year and a threeyear 295000 grant for a health education project by The Salvation Army  For its part German intermediary organization Misereor continues to use public money to support projects run by or benefitting the Catholic Church in Ghana  A spokesperson for Brot für die Welt told  the organization strives to engage in constant dialog with local churches on human rights BfdW is aware of some churches conservative and outdated attitude and very much concerned about the discriminating actions in which it sometimes manifests itself the spokesperson said  Misereor does not support projects that oppose LGBTQ rights in Ghana its spokesperson said In our internal dialogue with actors in the Church of Ghana we raise the issue and call for the indiscriminate observance of human rights for all people  Major donors complicit in fostering homophobia and transphobia in Ghana Caroline Koussaiman executive director of the Initiative Sankofa dAfrique de lOuest  Italys Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation told  it is not responsible for the use of these identified funds saying they go directly from peoples taxes to different religious organizations that distribute the money for development work The two religious institutions the ministry said sent some of this money to Ghanaian churches Conferenza Episcopale Italiana and Tavola Valdese did not respond to s requests for comment  The US Trade and Development Agency which allocated funds to the solar power project benefiting the Catholic church in 2019 and 2020 said Legislative and executive branch regulations in place at the time of USTDAs grant activity would not have prohibited funding by reason of the statements opposing LGBTQI rights that you provided  We urge Ghana to uphold constitutional protections and to adhere to Ghanas international human rights obligations and commitments with regard to all individuals including members of the LGBTQI community said a spokesperson for the US State Department which is the agency accountable for the grant the US provided to the CCG US government assistance is intended to improve the lives of all Ghanaians without discrimination  A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO formerly Department for International Development told  The UK has long been at the forefront of promoting LGBT rights internationally and we have regularly raised our concerns about the Family Values Bill with the Ghanaian authorities  A spokesperson for Christian Aid the charity that managed UK aid to the CCG said it is no longer active in Ghana adding it takes seriously its work to promote equality and helps tackle discrimination against LGBTQI communities in various countries  Earlier this year the UK acknowledged human rights abuses toward gender and sexual minorities in Ghana in a detailed report on the matter for Home Office decisionmakers evaluating related asylum claims  If the proposed bill passes many LGBTQI Ghanaians and their allies would be left with no choice but to try and flee the country    Credits  Editors Eliza Anyangwe Krystina Shveda  Data editor Krystina Shveda  Video Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Alex Platt  Photography Alex Platt', 'text_b': None,

       " {'guid': 19197, 'text_a': 'In the past two weeks COVID19 cases and hospitalizations have increased by more than 25 at a national level These are signs experts say that we may be entering a new COVID wave Getty Images  After what seemed a relatively stable fall season COVID19 is on the rise once again all across the United States just before Americans prepare to celebrate the holidays  In the past two weeks COVID cases and hospitalizations have jumped more than 25 Test positivity rates ICU admissions and the levels of virus detected in wastewater have also increased at a national level These are signs experts say that we may be entering a new COVID wave  Rochelle Walensky director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at a press briefing on Monday that this rise in cases and hospitalizations is especially worrisome as we move into the winter months when more people are assembling indoors with less ventilation and as we approach the holiday season where many are gathering with loved ones across multiple generations  The timing of this uptick in COVID activity is also concerning given that many health systems across the US are already dealing with an overwhelming number of patients stricken with RSV and influenza infections  Why are COVID19 cases on the rise  Winter is typically a busy time for hospitals because it is when many respiratory viruses emerge and more people especially in cold weather areas spend more time indoors This gives respiratory viruses including COVID19 more chance of spreading  Before Thanksgiving many experts predicted that an uptick in cases after the holiday could be expected especially since many people have stopped taking measures to mitigate the spread of the virus such as masking  Dr Michael Chang a pediatric infectious disease expert at UTHealth Houston and Childrens Memorial Hermann Hospital told  that while gathering for Thanksgiving may have contributed to the recent rise in COVID19 cases changes in the virus itself are probably driving this wave of infections  The coronavirus has continued to mutate and two new Omicron subvariants  known as BQ1 and BQ11  have now become dominant in the US Both of these have replaced BA5 the Omicron subvariant that had dominated infections in the US since the summer Together they now account for 62 of cases nationwide  Story continues  These variants are much more contagious than Omicron BA5 They are even more immuneevasive than Omicron BA5 unfortunately Chang said This means the new variants have the ability to bypass immunity acquired by vaccination treatments and prior infection  But Chang is optimistic that BQ1 and BQ11 wont have as severe an impact as previous variants Based on other countries experience of them he said it appears there isnt as much severe illness and hospitalization associated with them  He also explained that many Americans have some immunity from vaccination a recent Omicron infection or both Although this immunity may not be as strong against these new variants he said that for many people particularly the young and healthy it will still be enough protection against the most severe outcomes of the disease  Over the last few surges what weve seen is a decreasing trend So even though we have a large number of cases the number of cases that results in hospitalization and severe illness is not as high and I think thats going to be true for these new variants as well Chang said  Another factor experts say is contributing to the recent spike in COVID hospitalizations is waning vaccine protection The shots have been shown to lose their effectiveness over time This is why boosters are necessary to restore protection and are particularly important for those with the highest risk for severe COVID outcomes So far only 127 of eligible Americans have gotten the new bivalent booster according to CDC data  Empty shelves where cold and flu medicine are usually stocked in a CVS pharmacy in Burbank Calif on Tuesday Mario TamaGetty Images  Those 65 and older are most at risk of hospitalization  Although a rise in hospitalizations has been noted in all age groups the majority of COVID19 hospitalizations in recent weeks have been among older adults particularly those who have not received a booster shot in the past six months  Older people in our population above 65 especially those above 85 years of age Chang told  were starting to see an increasing percentage of severe illness and hospitalizations and deaths in that age group again  Immunity from the vaccines is not longlasting in this age group because of how the immune system works and an unfortunate consequence of aging Chang said  In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of CDC data researchers found that more of the deaths in recent months have been among seniors who were vaccinated but not boosted According to CDC data only 326 of adults 65 and older have received the bivalent booster since it became available three months ago  I think certainly older Americans who are not up to date on their vaccinations need to get up to date on their SARSCoV2 vaccinations as soon as possible including getting the bivalent booster Chang said  The bivalent booster offers the highest protection against COVID right now  On Monday Walensky emphasized how important it is for all Americans who are eligible for the bivalent booster to receive it this season She said those who have received only their primary series are considered fully vaccinated but they are not considered fully protected against severe disease this winter  The new bivalent booster she said is the highest defense against COVID19 severe disease at the moment The shot approved in September by the CDC was developed to target the BA4 and BA5 Omicron variants as well as the original strain of the virus  According to the agency people 12 and older who have had a bivalent booster shot have a 15 times lower risk of death than an unvaccinated person A recent CDC study also showed that the bivalent booster provided significant additional protection against infection in people who had previously received two three or four doses of the original vaccine monovalent Although it isnt clear yet how effective the shot is against BQ1 and BQ11 vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer have said their updated boosters work against these new variants  The CDC recommends that people 5 years and older receive the bivalent booster if it has been at least two months since their last vaccination whether that was the last dose of a primary series or an original booster  On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration also authorized the bivalent booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer for children as young as 6 months The FDA said in a statement that it is important to get young children vaccinated ahead of the holidays and winter months  Children between 6 months and 5 years old who received the Moderna twodose primary series can now receive Modernas bivalent booster two months after their second shot Similarly kids between 6 months and 4 years of age who have received two doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine can get the companies bivalent booster as a third shot Children in the same age group who have completed Pfizers threedose primary series however are not eligible to get this booster right now The FDA said it needed to evaluate more data to approve the shots for children in this group and that an update could come after January  The bivalent booster shot ramps up to a high level of protection in about a week and offers the highest protection within two weeks so experts recommend that people get vaccinated as soon as possible to be best protected before they travel and gather for the holidays  Tanvi Nayak 22 gets a bivalent COVID19 booster from a pharmacist Morgan Murphy at a CVS store in Chicago on Oct 13 Antonio PerezChicago TribuneTribune News Service via Getty Images  Other ways to stay protected against COVID19 this winter  Besides being up to date with their COVID19 vaccinations and getting the bivalent booster Chang said there are other steps people can take to prevent infection  One is staying home if you feel sick I know most people are looking forward to visiting with their friends and family but if youre symptomatic at all  you know sore throat runny nose even if you think its just a cold  I strongly recommend trying to stay home trying to avoid going out again he said  According to CDC guidance everyone who tests positive for the virus regardless of vaccination status should isolate at home for five days If symptoms resolve after that time you can leave isolation but should consider wearing a mask around others for five additional days  The CDC continues to recommend masking for residents of counties that have high community levels of COVID19 as well as for anyone who may be immunocompromised or at increased risk of severe disease People traveling by plane or taking any form of public transportation should also consider masking Walensky said  Improving ventilation and minimizing the size of gatherings whenever possible is also wise Chang advises  Finally Walensky encouraged Americans if they test positive for COVID19 to reach out to their health care provider immediately for early care Some treatments are available including the antiviral medication Paxlovid which if given within the first few days of illness can shorten the duration and severity of the disease All adults and children ages 12 and older are eligible for Paxlovid but the CDC recommends first consulting a doctor to help decide which of the treatments available if any is right for you  If you are still not sure what to do if you test positive for COVID this holiday season the CDC has a stepbystep guide with advice on what to do and a list of resources available to everyone for protecting against the virus', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

Abortion rights supporters had a successful run of ballot measures this year  In every state where voters were asked to weigh in directly on abortion rights they supported measures that protect those rights and rejected initiatives that could threaten them  Those victories have abortion rights advocates looking at where they can next take the fight directly to voters  Lets take this show on the road Lets go to states and lets prove that we can win in some challenging environment said Anthony Romero executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Lets put this to the people  Exploring options in red states  Romero who spent election night in Michigan celebrating the passage of an amendment to protect abortion rights in the states constitution said his group is looking at several states as potential targets for future ballot campaigns including Ohio and Florida  Kelly Hall executive director of the Fairness Project which advocates for progressiveleaning ballot measures said her organization is also exploring options in those states along with Missouri Oklahoma Arkansas and South Dakota She said gerrymandering in many states has resulted in lawmakers who support much deeper abortion restrictions than their constituents do  Hall said the initiative process can serve as a check on overreach by state lawmakers  when theres a huge gap between the desires of the electorate and the actions of politicians And nowhere is that more the case in America right now than on abortion rights  Loading  A serious problem for abortion opponents  Faced with these political losses antiabortion rights groups are emphasizing that they were outspent by their opponents in these campaigns and they say they believe that voters were misled by some of the messaging around these initiatives  Marjorie Dannenfelser president of SBA ProLife America told reporters on Wednesday that shes concerned more states will try to pass proabortionrights ballot measures like those in California Dannenfelser argued that its often better for abortion laws to be made by elected officials after a robust public debate  It is the biggest concern that we have in the prolife movement  that we gain our advantage that we find through candidates debating the issue  where we dont have that advantage when were outspent 10 to 1 in a referendum she said It is a serious problem  The groups vice president of state affairs Stephen Billy said he believes abortion rights supporters want to use the courts to try to take the issue out of voters hands by challenging antiabortion laws in state court and use ballot initiatives as a way to thwart the legislative process  A gap between legislation and public opinion  Advocates for bans on most abortions  including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks  are at odds with public opinion according to many years of polling While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion most support access earlier in pregnancy  Thats even the case in some deeply red states like Texas where since 2021 when a unique state law took effect residents have been seeing the impact of a ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy  Enlarge this image toggle caption Kyle RivasGetty Images Kyle RivasGetty Images  Romero with the ACLU said recent votes for abortion rights in red states show that many Republicanleaning voters are willing to cross party lines to push back against laws they see as overly restrictive He accuses Republican elected officials in many states of pandering to the most extreme portion of their base  thats holding Republican voters and the broader public hostage  You have to leapfrog the governors and you have the leapfrog the legislatures Romero said  Victories for abortion rights supporters this week in Kentucky and Montana followed a similarly successful fight in Kansas in August  Ballot measures face their own challenges risks  Many states lack a process for citizeninitiated ballot initiatives leaving the question of abortion in the hands of their state lawmakers According to the Fairness Project such

elect antiabortion candidates  But she said she believes that wellcrafted measures tailored to the specific concerns of voters in individual states can gain bipartisan support  These need to be strategic decisions that meet the electorate where it is Hall said I dont think though that we should shy away from having these deep strategic conversations even in the reddest of places  because frankly there are no other options left in many states for how we advocate for people who need reproductive healthcare  NYU law professor Melissa Murray said she believes theres a robust appetite among many voters to push back against some of the state restrictions that have taken effect in recent months though the specific message and rationale will vary from state to state  California may have a different logic for this than Kansas where the prospect of government encroachment might seem like the antithesis of conservatism Murray said But its all cashing out in the same way Where voters have direct access to the ballot box to register their preferences on abortion they are registering them in ways that make clear that there is  appetite for greater protections for reproductive

this into the body of the bill she said Getting this issue off the table and bringing some common sense to bear around the vaccine mandate was a very important thing to do  The Pentagon has 30 days

citing the thousands of service members who have been discharged across all military branches for refusing the vaccine And some of those had already had COVID Some of those had medical exemptions that

AR15style rifle killing five people and wounding 17 others was charged by prosecutors Tuesday with 305 criminal counts including hate crimes and murder El Paso County District Court via AP  COLORADO SPRINGS Colo AP  A judge dismissed the 2021 kidnapping case against the Colorado gay nightclub shooter even though she had previously raised concerns about the defendant stockpiling weapons and explosives and planning a shootout court transcripts obtained Friday by The  reveal  Relatives including the grandparents who claimed to have been kidnapped had also told Judge Robin Chittum in August last year about Anderson Aldrichs struggles with mental illness during a hearing at which the judge said Aldrich needed treatment or its going to be so bad according to the documents  Yet no mention was made during a hearing this July of the suspects violent behavior or the status of any mental health treatment  And Chittum who had received a letter late last year from relatives of Aldrichs grandparents warning the suspect was certain to commit murder if freed granted a defense attorneys motion to dismiss the case as a trial deadline loomed and the grandparents had stopped cooperating  ADVERTISEMENT  The revelation that Chittum regarded the defendant as a potentially serious threat adds to the advance warnings authorities are known to have had about Aldrichs increasingly violent behavior and it raises more questions about whether the recent mass shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs could have been prevented  Five people were killed and 17 wounded in the Nov 19 attack  Aldrich was charged last week with 305 criminal counts including hate crimes and murder Aldrichs public defender has declined to talk about the case and investigators have not released a motive  Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said transcripts of court hearings in the case confirmed his view that more could have been done to prevent the violence  Dershowitz acknowledged that he didnt know every detail in front of Chittum during the hearings but said that while judges are typically supposed to be umpires judges are usually more aggressive in cases like this when the handwriting is on the wall  In many cases Dershowitz said prosecutors can overreach to get a conviction but here you have the legal system failing  Chittums comments in Aldrichs kidnapping case had previously been under a court seal that was lifted last week at the request of prosecutors and news organizations including the AP Chittums assistant Chad Dees said Friday that the judge declined to comment  ADVERTISEMENT  You clearly have been planning for something else Chittum told Aldrich during the August 2021 hearing after the defendant testified about an affinity for shooting firearms and a history of mental health problems  It didnt have to do with your grandma and grandpa It was saving all these firearms and trying to make this bomb and making statements about other people being involved in some sort of shootout and a huge thing And then thats kind of what it turned into the judge said  Aldrich  whose defense lawyers say is nonbinary and uses theythem pronouns  spoke to Chittum in court that day about repeated abuse as a young child by their father and longtime struggles with severe posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder the transcript shows  ADVERTISEMENT  The vast majority of people with mental illnesses are not violent studies show and experts say most people who are violent do not have mental illnesses Additionally nonbinary people and advocates warn against making assumptions about people with nontraditional gender identities  Aldrich who was largely raised by their grandparents wanted to join the military as a teenager but decided it wasnt going to happen the transcripts show The suspect described refusing to take medications and then getting on track after moving to Colorado obtaining a medical marijuana license and starting college according to the transcripts  I also went to the shooting range as often as I could since the age of 16 Aldrich testified the transcripts show My mom and I would go  sometimes multiple times a week and have fun shooting This is a major pastime for me Going to school working and then relaxing at the shooting range  ADVERTISEMENT  Aldrich said they went to Dragonmans shooting range east of Colorado Springs where the dirt driveway was lined by mannequins that looked bloodied Friday Nearby were rusted vehicles some peppered in bullet holes Two people who appeared to work at the range said they did not know Aldrich and declined further comment  Shooting at the range was highly therapeutic for me and was a great way to spend spare time Aldrich told Chittum  When Aldrichs grandparents made plans to move to Florida the suspect became despondent Leading up to the 2021 confrontation with authorities Aldrich started drinking liquor regularly and smoking heroin dropped out of school and quit working the transcript shows  The charges in that case against Aldrich  who had stockpiled explosives and allegedly spoke of plans to become the next mass killer before engaging in an armed standoff with SWAT teams  were thrown out during a fourminute hearing this past July at which the prosecution didnt even argue to keep the case active  ADVERTISEMENT  The prosecution was the responsibility solely of the district attorney said Ian Farrell associate professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law noting that judges like Chittum have no power to force charges  Since a deadline for proceeding with Aldrichs trial was coming up and the prosecution clearly was not ready to proceed  the trial judge had no choice but to dismiss the case Farrell said  Judges can appoint special prosecutors in extreme situations such as when a decision not to prosecute is done in bad faith Farrell said But the 2021 case did not appear to rise to that bar he said because witnesses in the case were unavailable  Howard Black spokesperson for the district attorneys office has said he cannot share information about the kidnapping case because its part of the current investigation El Paso County District Attorney Michael Allen has said his office did everything it could to prosecute the case including trying to subpoena Aldrichs mother but has repeatedly declined to elaborate  During the 2021 standoff Aldrich allegedly told the frightened grandparents about firearms and bombmaking material in the basement of the home they all shared Aldrich vowed not to let the grandparents interfere with plans to go out in a blaze  Aldrich livestreamed on Facebook a subsequent confrontation with SWAT teams at the house of their mother Laura Voepel where the defendant eventually surrendered was arrested and had weapons ammunition and more than 100 pounds 45 kilograms of explosive materials seized  The FBI had received a tip on Aldrich a day before the threat but closed out the case just weeks later with no federal charges filed  By August 2021 when Aldrich bonded out of jail the grandparents were describing the suspect as a sweet young person according to the transcripts At two subsequent hearings that fall defense attorneys described how Aldrich was attending therapy and was on medications the transcripts show  In an October 2021 courtroom exchange Chittum told Aldrich to hang in there with the meds  Its an adjustment period for sure Aldrich replied to which the judge replied Yeah it will settle dont worry Good luck  The case had been headed toward a plea agreement early this year but fell apart after family members stopped cooperating and prosecutors failed to successfully serve a subpoena to testify to Aldrichs 69yearold grandmother Pamela Pullen who was bedridden in Florida  There is scant discussion in the transcripts of efforts by prosecutors to subpoena other potential witnesses  including Aldrichs mother grandfather and a fourth person who is listed in court documents but not identified  Although authorities missed some warning signs about Aldrichs capability for violence the opposite happened across the country in Minnesota this week where a man who said he idolized Aldrich was arrested after trying to buy grenades from an FBI informant and building an arsenal of automatic weapons to use against police according to charges  ___

       " {'guid': 19437, 'text_a': 'Before relinquishing or delaying their ambitions these potential challengers should refresh themselves on two important features of the last generation of presidential history  The first is that four out of the last five presidents reached the office only after ignoring the consensus view outward indications or prevailing wisdom about their prospects The willingness to defy smartset assumptions may be among the most important qualifications for the job  The second is that when the electorate is eager for change it usually finds a way to get it This suggests someone is going to try thisand do better than many people expect  This was the case with Bill Clinton He took the Democratic nomination in 1992 only after more established and seemingly formidable figures in his party declined to run apparently on the belief  which seemed plausible enough a year before election  that incumbent President George HW Bush in the wake of the successful first Gulf War was a prohibitive favorite for a second term  That was the case also with Barack Obama He announced his 2008 candidacy while still a newcomer to the US Senate declining to bow to the widespread belief that the Democratic nomination surely belonged to the betterknown Hillary Rodham Clinton  Eight years later the defier of conventional wisdom became its enforcer Obama was the most important Democratic voice nudging his vice president out of seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016 This time it really was Hillary Clintons turn nearly everyone believed One of the dissenters was Donald Trump  perhaps the supreme example of how it pays to be contemptuous of the establishment certitudes of both parties  The last example is Biden himself As late as February 2020 the very same voices who lately have pronounced him probably unstoppable for another nomination regarded him as a pathetic figure  how sad that he was ending a decadeslong career with a string of primary losses Wouldnt it be more dignified if he would gracefully step aside  This time all manner of ambitious nextgeneration Democrats from Gavin Newsom in California to Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan along with many others have stayed out of the race in deference to Biden The logic seemingly has two pillars The first is that Biden  in the wake of Democrats betterthanhistoricalaverage performance in the recent midterm elections  is actually much stronger than earlier supposed The second is that when incumbent presidents are challenged within their own party that usually helps the opposition party in the general election  Both pillars seem wobbly It is true that Democrats outperformed expectations last month and also true that younger voters came out in higher numbers than usual in midterms It is also true that Biden was not welcomed by Democrats to campaign for them in most closely contested races His approval ratings typically in the low forties are weakest among younger voters Nor was Election Day filled with dire portents for Republicans willing to separate themselves from Trump Republican governors who established their distance from Trump in Ohio and Georgia won easily as did Florida Gov Ron DeSantis who has drawn Trumps ire even while striking the same chords of populist resentment that fueled Trumps movement Their success in electoralpowerhouse states does not suggest an easy presidential election for Democrats two years from now  As for the conventional view that nomination contests are bad for incumbent presidents  such as Jimmy Carter in 1980 or Bush in 1992  it is more likely that these presidents are challenged because they are weak rather than that nomination contests left them fatally weakened  As for Trump the current assumption is that he could lose the GOP nomination to somebody  perhaps DeSantis  but would probably win it if he is challenged by a bunch of somebodies splitting the antiTrump vote  Collectively this has created a situation that my colleague Jonathan Martin channeling Oscar Wilde calls the bipartisan truth that dare not speak its name Many people in both parties want to shoo leaders off the stage but cant summon the courage to do so  It calls to mind the first time in the modern era that the political class was consumed with whether an incumbent president could be challenged Early in 1968 Robert Kennedy was agonizing over whether he had made a mistake in not running against incumbent Lyndon B Johnson Another Democrat Eugene McCarthy was gaining momentum on an antiVietnam War platform winning support from voters that Kennedy believed were naturally his He wanted to hear from an esteemed voice from an earlier generation the aging columnist Walter Lippmann In an exchange documented by biographers of both men Kennedy made the case why LBJs war policies were a disaster Then he made the case why a nomination challenge would probably be futile  Lippmann just listened quietly until Kennedy asked him directly what he thought Well Lippmann replied if you believe that Johnsons reelection would be a catastrophe for the country  and I entirely agree with you on this  then the question you must live with is whether you did everything you could to avert this catastrophe  Kennedy ultimately did run before an assassin stopped his campaign in June 1968 Lippmanns question however is one that should echo with every politician who thinks he or she should be a president than either Biden or Trump  all while biding time on the sidelines', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

high Too high for us to treat this scenario only hypothetically The Polish MON is allegedly planning to call up 200000 reservists in 2023 for a few weeks training but observers in Warsaw suspect this action could easily lead to a national mobilization  Meanwhile inside the Biden administration there is growing concern that the Ukrainian war effort will collapse under the weight of a Russian offensive And as the ground in Southern Ukraine finally freezes the administrations fears are justified In an interview published in the Economist head of Ukraines armed forces General Valery Zaluzhny admitted that Russian mobilization and tactics are working He even hinted that Ukrainian forces might be unable to withstand the coming Russian onslaught  Advertisement  Yet Zaluzhny rejected any notion of a negotiated settlement and instead pleaded for more equipment and support He went on to insist that with 300 new tanks 600 to 700 new infantry fighting vehicles and 500 new Howitzers he could still win the war with Russia Truthfully General Zaluzhny is not asking for assistance hes asking for a new army Therein lies the greatest danger for Washington and its NATO allies  When things go badly for Washingtons foreign policy the true believers in the great cause always draw deeply from the well of ideological selfdelusion to steel themselves for the final battle Blinken Klain Austin and the rest of the war party continue to pledge eternal support for Kiev regardless of the cost Like the best and the brightest of the 1960s they are eager to sacrifice realism to wishful thinking to wallow in the splash of publicity and selfpromotion in one public visit to Ukraine after another  This spectacle is frighteningly reminiscent of events more than 50 years ago when Washingtons proxy war in Vietnam was failing Doubters within the Johnson administration about the wisdom of intervening on the ground to rescue Saigon from certain destruction went into hiding In 1963 Washington already had 16000 military advisors in Vietnam The idea that Washington was supporting a government in South Vietnam that might not win against North Vietnam was dismissed out of hand Secretary of State Dean Rusk said We will not pull out until the war is won  By the spring of 1965 American military advisors were already dying General Westmoreland then commander of Military Assistance Command Vietnam reported to LBJ It is increasingly apparent that the existing levels of United States aid cannot prevent the collapse of South Vietnam North Vietnam is moving in for the kill Acting on the request of the South Vietnamese government the decision must be made to commit as soon as possible 125000 United States troops to prevent the Communist takeover  The Biden administrations unconditional support for the Zelensky regime in Kiev is reaching a strategic inflection point not unlike the one LBJ reached in 1965 Just as LBJ suddenly determined in 1964 that peace and security in Southeast Asia was a vital US strategic interest the Biden administration is making a similar argument now for Ukraine Like South Vietnam in the 1960s Ukraine is losing its war with Russia  Advertisement  Ukraines hospitals and morgues are filled to capacity with wounded and dying Ukrainian soldiers Washingtons proxy in Kiev has squandered its human capital and considerable Western aid in a series of selfdefeating counteroffensives Ukrainian soldiers manning the defensive lines facing Russian soldiers in Southern Ukraine are brave men but they are not fools The Spartans at Thermopylae were brave and they still died  The real danger now is that Biden will soon appear on television to repeat LBJs performance in 1965 substituting the word Ukraine for South Vietnam  Tonight my fellow Americans I want to speak to you about freedom democracy and the struggle of the Ukrainian people for victory No other question so preoccupies our people No other dream so absorbs the

Ukrainians to fight Now Washington must urge them to stop  NATOs governments are divided in their thinking about the war in Ukraine Except for Poland and possibly Romania none of NATOs members are in a rush to mobilize their forces for a long grueling war of attrition with Russia in Ukraine No one in London Paris or Berlin wants to run the risk of a nuclear war with Moscow Americans do not support going to war with Russia and those few who do are ideologues shallow political opportunists or greedy defense contractors  When US forces finally withdrew from Southeast Asia Americans thought that Washington would exercise greater restraint recognize the limits of American power and pursue a less militant and more realistic foreign policy Americans were mistaken then but Americans and Europeans

pass the plan before Friday and avert a partial government shutdown just before the Christmas holiday  The Senates 70 to 25 vote moves the legislation closer to final passage and House members were notified they will meet Thursday and remain in session until the spending package is completed Support from at least 10 GOP senators is needed for it to clear the Senate before the plan is taken up by the House and the early procedural vote was an indication of the level of support for the package Twentyone Republicans voted to begin debate on the spending measure  The measure known as an omnibus bill includes roughly 7725 billion for domestic priorities and 858 billion in defense funding as well as nearly 45 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine and roughly 40 billion in disaster relief for communities recovering from hurricanes wildfires drought and other natural disasters The package funds federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year on Sept 30 and includes reforms to the Electoral Count Act and a ban on TikTok on federal agencies devices  Senate leaders praised the deal reached by Democratic and Republican appropriations leaders in both chambers the last brokered by Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republican Sen Richard Shelby of Alabama before they retire  The American people need us to act quickly to avert the looming danger of a government shutdown Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Nobody wants a shutdown Nobody benefits from a shutdown and so I hope nobody here will stand in the way from funding the government ASAP  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who imposed a deadline of Dec 22 for the sweeping plan to clear the Senate acknowledged passing an omnibus spending package days before Christmas is not the right way to run the process but called for its approval  This is an impressive outcome for the Republican negotiators and more importantly it is the outcome that our country actually needs to keep helping Ukraine and our other friends to keep outinnovating and outcompeting Russia and China and to keep our brave men and women in uniform equipped with the best training tools and technologies the world has ever seen he said on the Senate floor  But complicating efforts to clear the spending plan in addition to facing a tight timeline is the opposition from a group of House and Senate Republicans who have been pushing for any spending talks to be postponed to January when the party takes control of the House and can demand spending cuts  This monstrous spending bill comes to 4155 pages We deserve proper consideration and the chance to read debate and amend  not a backroom deal Opposing this isnt radical running our government like this is whats radical Sen Mike Lee a Republican from Utah tweeted  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy who is working to secure enough votes from the Republican caucus to be elected speaker in January threatened that bills from GOP senators who vote in favor of the omnibus package will be dead on arrival in the House if this nearly 2T monstrosity is allowed to move forward over our objections and the will of the American people  Adding to the unease  and bolstering calls for swift action by lawmakers  is a winter storm that is expected to disrupt holiday travel  The sooner we pass the omnibus the better Schumer said  The White House said the legislation includes investments that advance a range of national priorities and advocated its passage  This bipartisan legislation demonstrates once more that both parties can come together to deliver for the American people and make progress on critical priorities for the nation it said in a statement The bill advances cuttingedge research on cancer and other diseases makes communities safer delivers for Americas veterans supports the Ukrainian people helps communities recovering from devastating natural disasters invests in child care and education and more  Text of the legislation was released just before 2 am Tuesday and includes a bevy of lawmakers projects stuffed into what is likely to be the last major bill of the current Congress  The government is already operating under a weeklong budget extension signed by President Biden on Friday and McConnell has warned that if the fiscal year 2023 spending measure fails to gain bipartisan support this week he would seek another shortterm patch into next year guaranteeing that the new Republican majority in the House would get to shape the package  Leahy argued against that approach in releasing the bill saying The choice is clear We can either do our jobs and fund the government or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path forward  Lawmakers are nearing completion of the 2023 spending package nearly three months late It was supposed to be finished by last Oct 1 when the governments fiscal year began  The last time Congress enacted all its spending bills by then was in 1996 when the Senate finished its work on Sept 30 the very last day of the budget year ThenPresident Bill Clinton signed it that same day  The bills unveiling was delayed by haggling over language related to the location of the FBIs future headquarters Maryland lawmakers have argued that ensuring predominantly Black communities get their fair share of federal investments should be more thoroughly considered as part of the selection process Theyre advocating for building the headquarters at one of two sites in Marylands Prince Georges County  In September when the General Services Administration issued a site selection plan based on five criteria the most heavily weighted at 35 was proximity to the FBI training academy in Quantico Virginia Advancing equity was weighted at 15  Democratic Sen Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said at a recent forum that a Biden executive order early in his administration emphasized that the issue of racial equity is not just an issue for any one department but it has to be the business of the whole government  I would submit that the GSA and the FBI clearly havent gotten the message given the low weight theyve given to this factor Van Hollen said  A Senate Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations said Schumer worked to incorporate language in the spending bill ensuring the GSA administrator conduct separate and detailed

more direct and public in their criticisms of the former president than others but without question something fundamental has changed  The GOP establishment is angry at Trump who announced his bid for reelection on November 15 for recently hosting a prominent white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and an antiSemite Ye the rapper formerly known as Kanye West for dinner For embracing QAnon For advocating for the termination of the Constitution For trashing the Supreme Court on which three of his nominees sit For promising to look very very favorably at pardoning January 6

obsessively promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 electionand they suffered the consequences  Scott Reed a veteran Republican strategist and a former top adviser to the US Chamber of Commerce told The New York Times that the past several weeks have been devastating for Trumps future viability  Abandonment has begun Reed said  Whether the damage Trump has sustained is enough to keep him from winning the 2024 nomination is impossible to know at this point Although the erosion in his support is significant a large part of the base has shown sustained loyalty to Trump  So how should those of us who for years have repeatedly warned Republicans about Trump view those who have finally done an aboutface in some cases mimicking the very criticisms that Never Trumpers have been making since the start of the Trump era  David Frum What the Never Trumpers want now  We ought to welcome their turnabout This is after all what many of us have been urging them to do Everyone makes mistakes and everyone should have the chance to correct those mistakes including onetime Trump enthusiasts Just as important purging Trump from Americas political landscape can only happen if the Republican Party first purges him from its ranks If people who once supported Trump are at last willing to cast him aside that is all to the good  But we shouldnt see a moral awakening where there is none The reason many longtime Trump supporters are deserting him is because they believe he is a loser and an impediment to their quest for power They are tossing Trump overboard because hes no longer useful to them Their considerations are practical rather than principled and precisely because the shift is for unprincipled reasons we should assume that if they calculate that Trump can win againand certainly if hes the Republican nominee in 2024they will once again rally around him  Nor are the belated resisters honestly reckoning with their recent proTrump past They are instead engaging in a series of rationalizations to explain why they enabled and championed this loathsome figure for so long  Some have simply chosen to forget their role in Trumps rise Some are eager to portray themselves as having been far more critical of Trump than they actually were Some prefer to turn the tables and go on the offensive chiding longtime critics of Trump for not forgiving and forgetting And still others are peddling a narrative in which Trump is only now spinning out of control Since the midterms were told something has snapped Trump has apparently lost touch with reality These people feign shock at what the man in MaraLago has become Who could possibly have seen this coming  All of this maneuvering is born out of a natural desire to escape moral accountability protect their reputation and not admit their mistakes and an even more intense desire to refuse to admit that Never Trumpers whom they view with contempt might have been right all along Their psychological defense mechanismsrationalizations intended to prevent feelings of guilt shame or discomfort about actions that on some level they know were wrong or unwiseare preventing them from coming to grips with their catastrophic misjudgments  Context is important here Were not talking about a mistaken assessment of the effects that tariffs might have on prices for consumers were talking about a party that

president and trying to overthrow the election  Read The GOP cant hide from extremism  At no point did Trump deceive Republicans into supporting him he simply broke them Formerly fierce critics such as Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham became lapdogs Republicans didnt change Trump he changed them Fundamental convictions or at least what had been sold as fundamental convictions were inverted Character in leaders used to matter we were tolduntil depravity became acceptable and even fashionable  As Trump descends further into madness its in the interests of Republicans to bury this record of iniquityto move on as if it were all some kind of surreal dream in the words of Andrew Sullivan But it wasnt a dream The trauma of the Trump years and the role of those who made them possible cant be papered over forgotten or pushed down what George Orwell called memory holes Individuals who allowed a man with fascist instincts into the Oval Office and once he was there provided him cover owe their fellow citizensand themselvesan honest accounting  Doing this would begin to repair one of the most damaging aspects of the Trump years which was his and his supporters gaslighting of America

process they are still relying on some bad habits including inviting the rest of us into their hall of mirrors  Trump supporters have deformed history and reality quite enough Even as we welcome them to the resistance we ought to expect from them an acknowledgment of the role they played in the rise and rule of Donald Trump  At some point all of us even the GOP will move on from Trump That process is hopefully well under way Healing our nation will require different things from different sides including some measure of civic grace and some measure of civic honesty Other nations more divided

misdemeanors there is profound racial disparity in the misdemeanor arrest rate for most  but not all  offense types according to a 2018 report from researchers from George Mason University and the University of Georgia   The NAACP Legal Defense Fund analyzed complaints against police in North Charleston South Carolina Thats where former officer Michael Slager shot an unarmed black man Walter Scott five times in the back as Scott was running away from a traffic stop The 2017 study found that black residents were more likely to file complaints than white residents  but NCPD sustained complaints filed by Black residents only 31 percent of the time compared to sustaining complaints filed by White residents 50 percent of the time the study says NCPD defines sustained as the allegation is supported by sufficient evidence to justify a reasonable conclusion that the allegation is factual   Latino youth are 65 more likely to be detained or committed than their white peers according to a 2017 report from The Sentencing Project   In the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health about 17 million white respondents and 4 million black respondents reported having used an illicit drug within the last month African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites the NAACP said   Researchers analyzed traffic safety stops in Kansas City and found no major racial disparities in ticketing for speeding But they found that blacks were 27 times more likely to be pulled over in an investigatory stop NPR station KCUR reported Blacks were also subject to searches five times more often than white drivers   That same study by three University of Kansas professors found stark differences in how white and black drivers were treated when they were pulled over Many white drivers who were surveyed described brief interactions with police But black drivers who had an infraction like a burnt out light were more often questioned about what they were doing in a particular neighborhood where they were heading and whether they were carrying drugs the report said Many were subject to vehicle searches  Tim Wise author of the book White Like Me took issue with OBriens belief that systemic racism doesnt exist in police forces  When you have the national security adviser saying he doesnt see systemic racism well you know what White folks also didnt see systemic racism even in the 1960s Wise said  He said polls prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 showed twothirds of white respondents said they believed black people were already being treated fairly in America  White folks looked around and basically said Eh whats the problem Wise said  If white America didnt get it even when it was obvious in retrospect to everyone what in the world would make the national security adviser believe that he or anyone else knows what theyre talking about now I think it probably stands to reason that black and brown folks know their reality better than we do  Officers also want to see change Some have marched alongside protesters to denounce excessive police force  The countrys largest law enforcement labor group the Fraternal Order of Police expressed condolences to Floyds family and said it is committed to helping improve the profession as a whole  We know what happens in communities when police officers lose the respect and trust of the public they protect FOP President Patrick Yoes said  Especially after a tragedy like we saw in Minneapolis we need to do two things  take a hard look at our own actions and conduct correct them where necessary and to regain that trust by continuing to hold ourselves to the highest possible standard in a transparent

Trump candidacy would create the need for a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations related to the former president sources familiar with the matter tell   The Justice Department is also staffing up its investigations with experienced prosecutors so its ready for any decisions after the midterms including the potential unprecedented move of indicting a former president Top aides to Trump have been eyeing the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his campaign with two sources telling  on Friday morning that the team has specifically discussed November 14  In the weeks leading up to the election the Justice Department has observed the traditional quiet period of not making any overt moves that may have political consequences But behind the scenes investigators have remained busy using aggressive grand jury subpoenas and secret court battles to compel testimony from witnesses in both the investigation into Trumps efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents kept at his Palm Beach home  Now federal investigators are planning for a burst of postelection activity in Trumprelated investigations That includes the prospect of indictments of Trumps associates  moves that could be made more complicated if Trump declares a run for the presidency  They can crank up charges on almost anybody if they wanted to said one defense attorney working on January 6related matters who added defense lawyers have have no idea who ultimately will be charged  This is the scary thing the attorney said  Trump and his associates also face legal exposure in Georgia where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating Trumps efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State and expects to wrap her probe by the end of the year  Indicting an active candidate for the White House would surely spark a political firestorm And while no decision has been made about whether a special counsel might be needed in the future DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the Justice Department from accusations that Joe Bidens administration is targeting his chief political rival people familiar with the matter tell   Special counsels of course are hardly immune from political attacks Both former special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation and special counsel John Durhams investigation into the origins of the FBIs Russia probe came under withering criticism from their opponents  The Justice Department declined to comment for this story  Bringing on a brain trust  The Justice Department has brought in a brain trust for highlevel advice on the Trump investigations according to people familiar with the moves  The Department of Justice building on Thursday Aug 18 2022 in Washington DC Kent NishimuraLos Angeles TimesGetty Images  Top Justice officials have looked to an old guard of former Southern District of New York prosecutors bringing into the investigations Kansas Citybased federal prosecutor and national security expert David Raskin as well as David Rody a prosecutorturneddefense lawyer who previously specialized in gang and conspiracy cases and has worked extensively with government cooperators  Rody whose involvement has not been previously reported left a lucrative partnership at the prestigious corporate defense firm Sidley Austin in recent weeks to become a senior counsel at DOJ in the criminal division in Washington according to his LinkedIn profile and sources familiar with the move  The team at the DC US Attorneys Office handling the daytoday work of the January 6 investigations is also growing  even while the offices sedition cases against rightwing extremists go to trial  A handful of other prosecutors have joined the January 6 investigations team including a highranking fraud and public corruption prosecutor who has moved out of a supervisor position and onto the team and a prosecutor with years of experience in criminal appellate work now involved in some of the grand jury activity  Taken together the reorganization of prosecutors indicates a serious and snowballing investigation into Trump and his closest circles  Garlands big decision  The decision of whether to charge Trump or his associates will ultimately fall to Attorney General Merrick Garland whom President Joe Biden picked for the job because his tenure as a judge provided some distance from partisan politics after Senate Republicans blocked his Supreme Court nomination in 2016  Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Jack GruberUSA Today  Several former prosecutors believe the facts exist for a potentially chargeable case But Garland will have to navigate the politically perilous and historic decision of how to approach the potential indictment of a former President  In March Garland avoided answering a  question about the prospect of a special counsel for Trumprelated investigations but said that the Justice Department does not shy away from cases that are controversial or sensitive or political  What we will avoid and what we must avoid is any partisan element of our decision making about cases Garland said That is what Im intent on ensuring that the Department decisions are made on the merits and that theyre made on the facts and the law and theyre not based on any kind of partisan considerations  Garlands tough decisions go beyond Trump The longrunning investigation of Hunter Biden son of the president is nearing conclusion people briefed on the matter say Also waiting in the wings a final decision on the investigation of Florida Republican Rep Matt Gaetz after prosecutors recommended against charges  It likely wont take long after the midterms for focus to shift to the 2024 presidential race That could incentivize top DOJ officials to make crucial charging decisions as quickly as possible including whether to bring charges against Trump himself or other top political activists other sources familiar with the Justice Departments inner workings say  Theyre not going to charge before theyre ready to charge one former Justice Department official with some insight into the thinking around the investigations said But there will be added pressure to get through the review of cases earlier than the typical fiveyear window DOJ has to bring charges  Georgia complications  Matters could also be complicated by the situation in Georgia where Willis is investigating Trumps efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election there Willis has said shes aiming for a special grand jury to wrap up its investigative work by the end of the year  Willis has observed her own version of a quiet period around the midterm election and is seeking to bring witnesses before the grand jury in the coming weeks Sources previously told  indictments could come as soon as December  Key Trump allies including South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are among witnesses that have tried to fight off subpoenas in the state probe into efforts to interfere with the Georgia 2020 election  How those disputes resolve in Georgia  including whether courts force testimony  could improve DOJs ability to gather information just as the House Select Committees January 6 investigation added to DOJs investigative leads from inside the Trump White House  A notso quiet period  The months leading up to the election have provided little respite from the political and legal activity around the investigations The DC US Attorneys Office  which is still shouldering the bulk of the January 6 investigations  has dealt with burnout in its ranks as prosecutors are taking to trial or securing guilty pleas from more than 800 rioters who were on the grounds of the Capitol and still look to charge hundreds more  Trump has also foiled the DOJs efforts to keep things quiet in the weeks leading up to the election leading to a steady barrage of headlines related to the investigation  Trumps legal team successfully put in place a complicated courtdirected process for sorting through thousands of documents seized from MaraLago to determine whether theyre privileged and off limits to investigators But the Justice Department and intelligence community have had access for weeks to about 100 records marked as classified that Trump had kept in Florida  The outcome of the intelligence review of those documents may determine if criminal charges will be filed according to one source familiar with the Justice Departments approach  Yet in both investigations underseal court activity never subsided with the Justice Department trying to force at least five witnesses around Trump to secretly provide more information in their grand jury investigations in Washington DC  has previously reported  On Tuesday a federal judge ordered Trump adviser Kash Patel to testify before a grand jury investigating the handling of federal records at MaraLago according to two people familiar with the investigation  Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court granted Patel immunity from prosecution on any information he provides to the investigation another significant step that moves the Justice Department closer to potentially charging the case  This story is breaking and will be

Devastating waves of COVID19  No one thinks this year will be anything like the last two dark pandemic winters at least when it comes to COVID19 But the country is now dealing with a different kind of threat  an uedictable confluence of old and new respiratory pathogens    Were facing an onslaught of three viruses  COVID RSV and influenza All simultaneously says Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Were calling this a tripledemic  Flu and RSV are back big time  The respiratory syncytial virus RSV began surging unseasonably early this year infecting babies and young children who had little or no immunity to that virus which wasnt circulating all that much over the past two years in part because of COVID19 precautions  The RSV resurgence is still flooding pediatric emergency rooms and intensive care units across the country Some parents are being forced to wait more than eight hours in emergency rooms for treatment for their very sick kids  Intensive care units are at or above capacity in every childrens hospital in the United States right now says Amy Knight president of the Childrens Hospital Association Its very very scary for parents  At the same time an unusually early and severe flu season is surging dominated by the H3N2 strain which often strikes kids and older people especially hard  Influenza has hit the southeastern United States Its moved into the Southwest Its going up the East Coast and into the Midwest with some ferocity Schaffner says  From coast to coast hospitalizations for the flu are at the highest level for this time of year in a decade according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Flu activity is high right now and continuing to increase says Lynnette Brammer an epidemiologist in the CDCs influenza division The good news is the vaccines this year are wellmatched to the viruses that are currently circulating and there is still time to get vaccinated  But now comes another Thanksgiving  These holiday celebrations with all their travel and their close contact usually function as virus accelerators Schaffner says Were spending a lot of time with each other Were laughing and breathing deeply And thats an ideal environment for these respiratory viruses to spread to others  What will COVID do this time  Of course COVID19 is still sickening tens of thousands and killing hundreds of people every day And new even more contagious omicron subvariants that are especially adept at infecting people  even if theyve been vaccinated or previously infected  are taking over    Theres a lot of moving parts here says Dr David Rubin whos been tracking the pandemic at the PolicyLab at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia  What is this all going to mean for COVID Are we going to see a JanuaryFebruary resurgence of COVID thats going to be fairly significant That may yet be coming  Many infectious disease specialists say the immunity people have from vaccinations and infections should keep any new surge of COVID19 infections from causing a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths  Im hopeful given where we are with COVID that were not looking at something like last winter But at the end of the day Mother Nature gets the final word on these things Dr Ashish Jha the White House COVID19 Coordinator told   Were in new territory here with three viruses all circulating at high levels simutaneously he says  I think its a really worrisome situation looking to the weeks coming ahead says Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist who runs the Pandemic Center at Brown University  Nuzzos worried because an exhausted nation has abandoned many of the precautions people were taking to protect themselves and others Flu vaccination rates are down by about 10 to 15 from previous years Only about 11 of those eligible for the new bivalent omicron boosters have gotten boosted  We cant just resign ourselves to assuming that its going to happen no matter what she says We can very much take action to prevent a rise in hospitalizations and deaths    Nuzzo and others experts say Americans can get vaccinated and boosted especially if they are at high risk because of their age or other health problems  People should consider Zooming for Thanksgiving if theyre sick testing for COVID19 before gatherings especially those involving older friends and relatives and other vulnerable people and even consider putting that mask back on as much as possible    If youre not eating or drinking its probably a smart idea to protect the immunocompromised the infants as well as the older individuals in the household says Dr Tina Tan an infectious disease specialist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine    There are hints that RSV may already be peaking and the flu could also peak early before any new COVID19 surge emerges That would help relieve at least some of the pressure on hospitals  Theres even a theoretical possibility that the flu and RSV could blunt any new COVID19 surge in the same way the coronavirus crowded out those viruses the last two years One possibility is a phenomenon known as viral interference which involves the presence of one virus reducing the risk of catching another  COVID could be outcompeted which is potentially good news Rubin says', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

shared a passion for bigoted publicity stunts and happily heckled Joe Biden together at the State of the Union But their friendship appears to be crumbling  Boebert took a surprising swipe at Greene during an interview on Monday when asked whether she would support House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthys bid to become House speaker in the next Congress as her longtime ally Greene does Boebert balked at the question Well you know Ive been aligned with Marjorie and accused of believing a lot of the things that she believes in I dont believe in this just like I dont believe in Russian space lasers Jewish space lasers and all of this she said to laughter from her audience before explaining the conditions on which shed personally back McCarthy  Boebert and Greene are choosing different paths as they reckon with different costs and benefits of their diverging experiences with rightwing populism  Boebert was not just mocking Greenes antisemitic conspiracy theory posted in 2018 speculating that Rothschildbacked space lasers cause wildfires she was signaling that she doesnt want to be grouped together with Greene anymore  Greene was swift to strike back On Twitter she scoffed at Boeberts slim margin of victory in her reelection and lamented that Boebert childishly threw me under the bus for a cheap sound bite Greene also accused Boebert of turning her back on McCarthy Trump and Greene herself despite their support for her  Greene slammed Boebert for engaging in high school drama but in reality their row runs deeper than personal tension The emerging fissures shed light on the dilemmas the MAGA right faces in this political moment Boebert and Greene are choosing different paths as they reckon with different costs and benefits of their diverging experiences with rightwing populism  Right now Greene is feeling good She comfortably won reelection in her deepred Georgia district and paid no penalty for her affiliation with the QAnon conspiracy theory or white supremacist Nick Fuentes She has little reason to consider her fringe views a political liability  Somewhat counterintuitively Greene also has a stake in backing the status quo when it comes to supporting McCarthy as he goes up for a vote to become House speaker in January Despite her bombthrowing political extremism Greene has developed a mutually beneficial relationship with McCarthy McCarthy is a political opportunist who likely sees her status as a powerful fundraiser and a political celebrity who can get the base riled up as good for the party  And there are signs that Greene has extracted some promises from McCarthy as he scrambles to get the support he needs to become speaker  a vote during which he can afford no more than four defections from within his party Shortly after Greene took office Democrats stripped her of her committee assignments after reports emerged showing that she endorsed a call for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be killed It appears that McCarthy not only plans on allowing her to rejoin committees but on giving her important ones and possibly one that will allow her to sit front and center in investigating the Biden administration  By contrast Boebert is  not feeling so good As of last spring she already appeared to be objecting to some of Greenes most extreme views they reportedly looked as if they were about to come to literal blows during an argument after Greene had attended one of Fuentes events And Boebert likely now views her affiliation with the most extreme elements of MAGA world as politically dangerous after nearly being ousted from office by a Democrat in her conservative Colorado district She won reelection by a little over 500 votes  MAGA ideology continues to live in Congress but its also growing more complicated  Boebert has not expressed any kind of wholesale reevaluation of MAGA ideology but its clear she is picking her political battles more carefully and could be hesitant to lean into controversy the way Greene continues to relish  Boebert seems to be threading the needle with her current position on McCarthy Shes said that shell back him for speaker if he revives a rule that would make it easier for lawmakers to oust a speaker from their position during their term Its a strategic posture because it allows her to stake out a rebellious position gives her and her farright colleagues more opportunities to kick McCarthy out of leadership if they feel moved to assuming he agrees to the rule change and it allows her to present herself as someone who is willing to compromise rather than take the hardline no to McCarthy position of a few of her MAGA colleagues  Greene and Boebert might have more in common than not But theyre learning different lessons from the past couple of years and they have diverging interests going forward MAGA ideology continues to live in Congress but its also growing more complicated', 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

  Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  LITTLETON Colo  When the Supreme Court ruled narrowly in 2018 for a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple the justices avoided declaring a clear winner in the cultural conflict between LGBTQ rights advocates and those who say their religious beliefs forbid countenancing samesex marriage  It turns out that the next such case which the Supreme Court takes up Monday was just a short drive away  About five miles from Jack Phillipss Masterpiece Cakeshop the focus of the battle four years ago is a cheerful office in a nondescript building Graphic designer Lorie Smith says the same Colorado public accommodation law that Phillips challenged which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation also violates her deeply held religious views and freespeech rights  Advertisement  Smith wants to expand her business to create wedding websites but only to tell the stories of brides and grooms through Gods lens And she wants to be able to tell samesex couples on her 303 Creative LLC website that she will not create such platforms for them  Colorado is censoring and compelling my speech and really forcing me to pour my creativity into creating messages that violate my convictions Smith said in a recent interview with one of her lawyers sitting nearby There are some messages I cannot create  Two courts have ruled against Smith saying Colorado has a compelling interest to require that businesses that are open to the public serve all of the states citizens  No matter how authentic Smiths broad freespeech argument may be state Attorney General Philip J Weiser D told the Supreme Court in his brief it would encompass not only a businesss religious beliefs but also objections motivated by ignorance whim bigotry caprice and more  including pure expressions of racial sexist or antireligious hatred  Advertisement  When the court took Smiths case it declined to hear Smiths claim that Colorados law violates her religious freedom Nor did it agree to hear her request to overturn Supreme Court precedent on neutral laws that might have implications for religious believers  Instead the justices propose to answer this question Whether applying a publicaccommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment  And some court observers say that decision could have even more impact  Smith is represented by the same conservative legal organization that defended Phillips Her case has been years in the making But it arrives at a moment of discordancy over the LGBTQ rights movement  Nationally Congress is on the verge of providing landmark federal recognition of samesex marriage a step unthinkable even a decade ago But the effort is motivated significantly by fear that the Supreme Court might one day renege on the constitutional right for samesex couples to marry that it found in 2015  In Colorado residents last year saw their historymaking governor Jared Polis marry first gentleman Marlon Reis in an intimate ceremony still grand enough to merit high society coverage But last month the LGBTQ community and the nation was shocked when a gunman stormed a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs shooting dozens of patrons and killing five  Some wonder how the state has come to play such a prominent role in the Supreme Courts consideration of whether samesex marriage will be treated differently from traditional marriage  Advertisement  The Colorado legislature never approved samesex marriage instead it was decreed by federal courts But far earlier by 2008 the state had outlawed discrimination against gay people in housing public accommodation and employment and it established civil rights protections on the basis of gender identity  It is really wild to think about how far weve come said Garrett Royer the director of One Colorado an advocacy group for the LGBTQ community But he added that he thinks the success of the movement has made the state something of a target  I think the conservative movement is looking at how do we chip away at this very progressive nondiscrimination law in Colorado Royer said And that has implications at the national level to take back these protections  In an interview Smith declined to answer whether she thinks samesex marriage should be legal and she said her case is personal not political She works for LGTBQ clients on other topics she said A victory for her she said would be just as valuable to a gay artist who does not want to create for a cause in which she does not believe  Advertisement  The case comes before a court much changed since the 2018 decision which left the Colorado law undisturbed but said officials enforced it unfairly against Phillips because of religious bias on the part of some  Justice Anthony M Kennedy who wrote that threadtheneedle opinion as well as the courts landmark decisions on gay rights including marriage has retired Also gone is a dissenter in the Phillips case Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg She was the first justice to officiate at a samesex wedding and was an advocate who warned that treating samesex couples differently from oppositesex ones would afford the new unions only a skimmilk version of marriage  Kennedy and Ginsburg were replaced by moreconservative justices on a court that has been protective of free speech rights and increasingly sympathetic to challenges brought by religious interests It is highly unlikely that the court took Smiths case simply to affirm the lowercourt rulings  Kristen Waggoner the president chief executive and general counsel of Alliance Defending Freedom the conservative organization representing Smith said the court need not break new ground to rule for the businesswoman  Advertisement  Public accommodation laws and the First Amendment have coexisted peacefully for years and years for decades Waggoner said in an interview This case isnt about whether they will continue to do so its just about whether the court will continue to follow the precedent thats already set  Waggoners brief relies on seminal First Amendment cases that found that the government may not in her words compel speakers to endorse certain messages and eschew others  In 1995 the court unanimously ruled  in Hurley v IrishAmerican Gay Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston  that a public accommodation law could not be used to compel organizers of Bostons St Patricks Day parade to admit a gay rights group And Waggoners brief begins with the courts famous 1943 decision that Jehovahs Witnesses students in West Virginia could not be compelled to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance  Advertisement  Colorados law turns those principles upside down such that artists must now speak governmentsanctioned messages stop speaking their own preferred message or leave the market in which they hope to participate Waggoner writes  Colorado responds that even if the websites Smith wants to produce are expressive  she has not actually accepted commission for one to avoid running afoul of the law  she is conflating free speech with selling a product The states residents should not have to worry about whether a business will reject them because of who they are  The laws application does not turn on what a business chooses to sell Weiser writes in the states brief It simply requires that once a business offers a product or service to the public the business sells it to all  Smith the state says is free to offer only websites that include biblical quotes describing marriage as the union of one man and one woman But then the company must sell whatever it offers to customers regardless of their race religion sexual orientation or other protected characteristic    Both believers and atheists can choose to buy its websites with biblical quotes  The state says that Smith proposes to post on her company website the message that I will not be able to create websites for samesex marriages or any other marriage that is not between one man and one woman  Advertisement  Under Colorados protection of gay citizens Weiser wrote this amounts to an announcement of illegal discrimination similar to a white applicants only sign  It is also not enough that other companies would provide similar marriage services to samesex couples the state says The court made that clear decades ago ruling against a motel that wanted to serve only White guests and a restaurant owner who said an integrated dining room would violate his religious beliefs  Smiths lawyer responds that throwing in racism is simply an attempt to shut down the debate and frankly its offensive to malign people like that She said Smith would create a website for an interracial couple or an interfaith couple  so long as the couple was heterosexual  What matters Waggoner said is not whether Smith is creating speech for profit  our First Amendment rights arent contingent on whether youre trying to earn a living  but that it is a custom project that reflects Smiths beliefs  Advertisement  Even a finished product might be protected Waggoner said Think of the rock star who doesnt want his recorded songs played at the rallies of a politician he abhors  Smith is supported by a long list of religious organizations and academics who say creating custom speech is different from past public accommodation cases  Law professors Dale Carpenter a supporter of gay rights and Eugene Volokh a First Amendment specialist said in a friend of the court brief that a line can be drawn On the protected side of those who create expression related to weddings web site creators writers photographers painters singers and similar speakers On the other those who perform distinct activities such as baking clothing design architecture and other media  The state of Colorado is supported by the Justice Department which under the Biden administration has switched its position since the Phillips case Also supporting Colorado are the freespeechdefending American Civil Liberties Union and others  The Colorado law does not deserve the courts most exacting scrutiny the ACLU says because it is aimed at making services open to all not censoring Smiths opinions about marriage  GiftOutline Gift Article', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

state in 2024 and beyond  Senator Raphael Warnock defeated Herschel Walker in convincing fashion on Tuesday overcoming a difficult national environment for Democrats and cementing Georgias status as the crucible of American politics  Mr Warnock not only gave Democrats some breathing room in a closely divided Senate but also provided grist for Republicans hoping to dethrone former President Donald J Trump as the leader of their party Even as the votes were still being tallied Mr Trumps critics on the right were lashing him for saddling them with an untested and troubled candidate for a seat they believed was theirs to win  Mr Warnocks victory also guaranteed  if there was any doubt  that Georgia will be hotly contested two years from now when President Biden or another Democrat tries to

Walkers election party on Tuesday night in Atlanta Credit Nicole Buchanan for The   Republicans chose a deeply flawed candidate  The Warnock campaign wanted to make the race a contrast between a reverend and a running back not a referendum on national Democrats or the Biden administration  In Mr Walker the senators team had the perfect foil Lurid allegations about his personal conduct drove national news previously undisclosed children he had fathered accusations of domestic violence abortions he had reportedly urged romantic partners to get exaggerations about his business affairs questions about his residency in Georgia  Facing incessant doubts about his fitness for office Mr Walker tried selfabasement Im not that smart he said at one point It was a deft strategy for lowering expectations ahead of his lone debate with Mr Warnock But in voicing the very concerns many Republicans held he might have helped to crystallize them  Mr Walkers problems were especially acute in metropolitan Atlanta where voters tend to be wealthier and more educated During the general election in Fulton County for instance he lagged the vote total of Gov Brian Kemp a fellow Republican by a larger margin than his entire statewide gap with Mr Warnock  But Mr Walker made little attempt to lure back those wayward Kemp voters and kept serving up red meat instead I dont even know what the heck is a pronoun he said at one rally At another he said that Jesus may not recognize transgender people if they seek to enter heaven In much of the state he lost ground between Nov 8 and the runoff by several percentage points  Other comments became fodder for Mr Warnocks attack ads Mr Walker extolled the virtues of gasguzzling cars in a state that has aggressively tried to become a hub of electricvehicle manufacturing And in comments that made him the butt of latenight jokes he embarked on a lengthy tangent about werewolves and vampires  Walkers loss turns up the heat on Trump  It will be hard  though not impossible  for Mr Trump to wriggle his way out of this one Mr Walker had explored running for office long before 2022 But Mr Trump who had known Mr Walker since the 1980s when he owned the New Jersey Generals football team in the shortlived USFL almost singlehandedly made Mr Walkers candidacy a reality  Wouldnt it be fantastic if the legendary Herschel Walker ran for the

Republican consultant they just rallied around Herschel  During the runoff Republicans made clear that they wanted Mr Trump to stay away Instead of one of his signature MAGA rallies in Georgia the former president was reduced to holding a conference call to support Mr Walker that was closed to the news media  Many Republicans previously mindful of the former presidents capacity for survival are now shedding their caution If Georgia Republicans want to keep laying in the mud with Donald Trump said Lt Gov Geoff Duncan its going to be a purple state  Even before Mr Walkers loss Republicans of all stripes were eyeing Gov Ron DeSantis of Florida as a preferable alternative in 2024 and he has gained ground against Mr Trump in every major poll since Nov 8 This week has been brutal for Mr Trump On Monday a parade of Republican senators lined up to condemn his recent call to suspend the Constitution on Tuesday a jury convicted his company of tax fraud  As the runoff outcome became clear Scott Jennings a former aide to Senator Mitch McConnell observed that Georgia may be remembered as the state that broke Trump once and for all  Georgia will again be a key state on the presidential map in 2024  Watching the explosive growth of metropolitan Atlanta over the last decades and especially the surge in Asian American and Latino voters Republicans began to worry that their grip on the state was eroding  They watched in 2016 as Hillary Clinton flipped Cobb County a fastdiversifying former Republican stronghold in the Atlanta suburbs on her way to losing the state by just five percentage points In 2018 when Stacey Abrams came within 14 points of beating Mr Kemp in her first race for governor she won Cobb by nearly 10  But its simplistic to say that demographics is destiny On Nov 8 Republicans won every statewide office other than senator including Mr Kemps by an average of about seven points  That makes Mr Warnocks victory all the more remarkable But it was by no means foreordained and a stronger opponent might have beaten him Had Mr Warnock lost many would now be questioning whether the Democrats victories in 2020 and 2021 were anomalies After all Mr Biden won the state by fewer than 12000 votes  The president in a sign of how centrally he views Georgia to his reelection hopes has urged his party to add the state to the early presidential nominating calendar in 2024 Theres just one problem Republican officials in Georgia will get to decide if that happens and theyve already poured cold water on the idea  Either way the path to 270 Electoral College votes looks much the same for Mr Biden in 2024 as it did in 2020 Win every swing state in the Midwest plus Nevada and New Hampshire and keep Arizona and Georgia blue just in case  Image Senator Raphael Warnocks electionnight party on Tuesday night in Atlanta His victory showed the power of Democrats voter turnout operation in Georgia Credit Nicole Craine for The   Democrats have built a turnout machine in Georgia  Much has been made of the Democrats astonishingly durable coalition in Nevada the core of which is unionized casino workers in Las Vegas But Democrats have assembled a no less formidable turnout operation in Georgia a much more populous and more geographically complex state  Although metropolitan Atlanta represents nearly 60 percent of the electorate to win the big statewide races Democrats needed to find pockets of new voters elsewhere too Black communities in places like Albany in southwest Georgia often went neglected In 2017 Ms Abrams made a statement by announcing her campaign there rather than in Atlanta  One of the things weve done better with is not running a metrocentric campaign building organizing infrastructure across the state said Jonae Wartel who directed the 2021 runoffs for Democrats  Another secret to Democrats success in Georgia is patience A core network of organizers has stuck around for years building relationships across the state and prioritizing local roots After the 2021 Senate races the state Democratic Party immediately hired several of the top brains behind Mr Warnocks and Senator Jon Ossoffs field teams then asked them to write detailed reports on what they had learned  Theres a yearround organizing conversation in Georgia said Nse Ufot the former chief executive of the New Georgia Project a nonprofit that became an organizing hub for activists across the state Its not transactional  Democrats overcame a restrictive new voting law  If Georgia Republicans were hoping that making it harder to vote would help them win back the Senate seat they lost in 2021 they were wrong And there are signs that the changes they put in place might have backfired in some respects  The battle over voting rights kept Mr Warnocks base busy between elections In 2021 when Republicans passed a major new voting law that Democrats and civil rights groups denounced as an attempt to suppress Black votes the machine went to work Mr Warnocks strategists adjusted their voter contact plans accordingly while outside activists held protests organized petition drives and basically kept their network buzzing all year  We dont let it lay dormant Ms Wartel said  For Gerald Griggs the president of the Georgia chapter of the NAACP the lesson is not that the outcry over the law was a false alarm as Republicans have insisted  Anticipating long lines at the polls civil rights groups planned parties to the polls all over the state featuring water and live entertainment just beyond the minimum distance from polling locations mandated by the new rules And the NAACP threatened to sue counties that allowed frivolous lawsuits under provisions of the voting law that allowed unlimited challenges to individual ballots  African Americans in this state know how to mobilize Mr Griggs said But you shouldnt have to outorganize voter suppression  Ruth Igielnik contributed reporting', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

Records show the South Dakota troops didnt seize any drugs AP PhotoStephen Groves File  SIOUX FALLS SD AP  South Dakota Gov Kristi Noem described the US border with Mexico as a war zone last year when she sent dozens of state National Guard troops there saying theyd be on the front lines of stopping drug smugglers and human traffickers  But records from the Guard show that in their twomonth deployment the South Dakota troops didnt seize any drugs On a handful of occasions they suspected people of scouting for lapses in their patrols but mission logs dont contain any confirmed encounters with transnational criminals And a presentation from the deployment noted that Mexican cartels were assessed to be a moderate threat but were unlikely to target US forces  Some days the records show the troops had little if anything to do  Very slow day No encounters It has been 5 days since last surrender wrote one Guard member whose name was redacted from a situation report created as the deployment neared its end in September 2021  ADVERTISEMENT  For Noem who is up for reelection Tuesday amid speculation she could be a 2024 White House contender  the deployment was an eyecatching jump into a political fight more than 1000 miles 1609 kilometers from her state Noem justified the deployment  and a widely criticized private donation to fund it  as a state emergency Dangerous drugs she said made their way to South Dakota after coming over the southern border  But the documents obtained by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington through an open records request cast doubt on whether the deployment was effective at stopping drug trafficking even as Noem claimed that Guard members directly assisted in stopping it  Most drugs dont come through unwatched expanses of the border or the Rio Grande where the Guard members were stationed said Victor Manjarrez a former Border Patrol senior officer who is now a professor of criminal justice at the University of Texas at El Paso They are smuggled into the United States at established border checkpoints he said  South Dakota Guard members were stationed at observation posts where they parked Humvees or other military vehicles alongside the Rio Grande They watched for groups of migrants to report to Border Control which would then take them into custody On several occasions they reported groups of hundreds of people migrating and at one point a Guard member performed CPR on a child who had drowned  ADVERTISEMENT  During the twomonth deployment the Guard logged 204 people who were turned back to Mexico and 5000 others who were apprehended by the Border Patrol to evaluate for asylum claims Those apprehensions were a small fraction of the over 162000 encounters Border Patrol reported during July and August in the Rio Grande Valley Sector  the 34000squaremile swathe where the Guard was stationed  Like any operation there are going to be busy days and some slow days that is expected in all operations Marshall Michels a spokesman for the South Dakota Department of the Military said in an email response to questions on the records from AP  ADVERTISEMENT  Noem last year joined with seven other Republican governors to harden the border through Texass Operation Lone Star The statebacked mission sought to discourage migrants by making arrests under Texas laws  The mission gave Republicans occasion to deride President Joe Bidens border policies but the operation has not curbed the number of people crossing the border It has also faced criticism for being a rushed mission that gave members little to do while potentially running afoul of federal law  Noems decision to send 48 Guard members was met with particularly harsh criticism because she covered most of its cost with a 1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire who has often donated to Republicans Top brass from the National Guard Bureau and an aide to South Dakota US Sen John Thune a fellow Republican questioned what legal authority the state had to accept a donation to fund the deployment the recently released emails show  ADVERTISEMENT  CREW Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the South Dakota Guard and the US Army after they refused a Freedom of Information Act request for records on the deployment and communication between the National Guard the governors office and the Department of Defense Under that legal pressure the agencies turned over the documents which CREW shared with The   Noah Bookbinder CREWs president said they wanted to bring transparency to a donation that he called a particularly craven example of how money can drive not just politics but how governments operate and how military forces can be used  Congress later banned such private donations for Guard deployments  Noems administration has insisted that the National Guard with its military training was bestsuited to tackle what she called a national security crisis  It literally is a war zone she told reporters this July  Noems office referred questions on the deployment to a statement last year when she called Bidens border policy an utter disaster that facilitated illegal border crossings and said that Mexican cartels were using the surge in migrants as a distraction for their criminal activities  ADVERTISEMENT  The scope of the drug smuggling and human trafficking taking place has been made clear to us and it is staggering she said  During the twomonth deployment Guard members reported spotting 11 people they deemed to be scouting for lapses in surveillance On another occasion recorded in the logs Guard members pointed flashlights at five people with backpacks crossing the Rio Grande who then retreated Maj Gen Jeffrey Marlette the head of South Dakotas Guard later told a South Dakota legislative committee they were likely carrying drugs  Those were the only times the Guard members reported suspected drug trafficking The South Dakota National Guard said it accomplished its mission by supporting Texass Operation Lone Star and referred questions on its success to the Texas National Guard  Texass 17month operation has recorded 21000 criminal arrests with most of those resulting in felony charges Gov Greg Abbotts office recently reported The Texas National Guard also said it has been responsible for 470000 migrant detections apprehensions

       " {'guid': 21997, 'text_a': 'In the race among US law enforcement agencies to be the snoopiest most intrusive and greatest threat to privacy its really hard to score the players To a great extent thats because the eavesdroppers and keyholepeepers are more enthusiastic about monitoring us than they are about letting us know that theyre watching Fortunately the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF is there to keep an eye on things and to let us know who is the nosiest of them all  This week EFFs Atlas of Surveillance project hit a bittersweet milestone EFFs Dave Maass director of investigations noted Nov 17 The Atlas of Surveillance has now hit 10000 data points It contains at least partial data on approximately 5500 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states as well as most territories and districts  While incomplete as is unavoidable in any effort to track government bodies that resent being subject to the sort of scrutiny they inflict on others the Atlas of Surveillance is a fascinating source of information we previously covered it in 2020 when it included only 3000 agencies Its of clear value to journalists civil liberties advocates and anybody concerned about going about their business with a modicum of privacy The Atlas is searchable mappable and allows you to select or deselect specific types of surveillance such as licenseplate readers doorbellcamera networks and facial recognition Thats handy for determining the pervasiveness of the surveillance state where you live and for planning journeysalthough good luck picking entirely anonymous routes  I searched for Cottonwood Ariz the nearest town to my home Like many lawenforcement agencies the Cottonwood Police Department uses bodyworn cameras to minimize disputes over what happens in interactions between police and the public The nearby YavapaiApache Nation Tribal Police Department also uses bodyworn cameras as do many Arizona lawenforcement agencies  The Atlas also reveals that the Cottonwood Police Department has a partnership with Ring the Amazonowned homesecurity company that allows police access to doorbellcamera footage from customers Participation was originally sold as voluntary but we now know that Ring makes recordings available on police request without a warrant  Its a relatively easy way to build a surveillance state installed and paid for by those being scrutinized  Out of curiosity I also pulled up a map of the road trip my son and I recently took to visit the campus of Kansas State University I like driving to see the sights but even with no highway equivalent of the TSA yet its increasingly difficult to escape scrutiny on these journeys According to the Atlas of Surveillance we passed through jurisdictions that in addition to bodycams and doorbell cameras register private surveillance cameras for official use monitor the public with drones detect gunshots use facial recognition track cellphones and automatically check passing license plates against databases  On Interstate 40 the village of Milan NM partnered with a tech startup Flock Safety to install two license plate reading cameras around the village according to KRQE One near the interstate and the other near Milan Elementary School The cameras scan a vehicles license plate and can send a realtime alert to police when a car comes up stolen or if the driver is a fugitive  By that point wed already passed through the drones and automatic license plate readers of the Navajo County Sheriffs Department in Arizona  Unsurprisingly interstates are the most highly scrutinized roads with greaterthough not completeprivacy afforded on smaller lesstrafficked roads The leg of our journey in Kansas probably went largely unmonitored especially since we used cash for gas and meals  Around town government surveillance cameras home doorbell cameras and other private cameras accessible by police are the greatest concern Some jurisdictions have restricted police use of certain surveillance technology such as facial recognition But San Francisco is one of those jurisdictions and it recently eased the way for increased police access to private surveillance cameras in realtime A policy lasts right up until its reversed  Likewise Ring currently doesnt include facial recognition in its offerings and the company swears it will neither sell nor offer facial recognition technology to law enforcement But the company also holds patents on the technology and several competitors offer facial recognition though theyre not so closely associated with police departments  Few of these surveillance systems are networked together at present though the Ring network comes the closest because its based around one company Licenseplate cameras and facialrecognition software are also often tied into private databases that serve multiple jurisdictions Last year BuzzFeed news put together a list of 1803 government agencies that used or had tried facial recognition tools from marketleading Clearview AI The dominant licenseplate reader company is now Motorola since it acquired the parent company of Vigilant Solutions in 2019  Frankly its difficult to see the future as anything other than more closely surveilled and in a more coordinated way Law enforcement agencies are likely to coordinate their efforts through multijurisdictional efforts such as the US Department of Justices Regional Information Sharing Systems which increase reach while reducing costs and technical challenges They can also sign up as subscribers to one or more privately developed plugandplay surveillance networks  Those of us who are especially surveillanceaverse will still take active measures to obscure our trail through purchases made in cash face masks clothing that confuses algorithms and leaving our cellphones at home But we will still be watched and chances are that making efforts to preserve anonymity will itself come to be seen by the powers that be as suspicious  So privacy may be dead at least in public spaces That means its that much more important to make use of tools like the Atlas of Surveillance to publicize who is watching and what they are doing with the information That will be an important step towards pulling the teeth of the snoopy agencies and limiting the scope of the laws they enforce so that were not at constant risk from unsleeping eyes We might not be able to completely preserve our anonymity but we should make every attempt to reduce the danger those monitoring us can pose with the information they gather', 'text_b': None, 'label': 3},\n",

affiliated with a conservative group after alleged voter intimidation Claire Hardwick   On the eve of midterm elections in America  as Jan 6 insurrectionists remain on trial as candidates nationwide deny the results from 2020 as the president warns of a path to chaos  experts on voting and extremism want to make two things clear  First voting in the United States remains extraordinarily safe  Second as millions of Americans still seethe over the 2020 election and cast doubt on the fairness of the electoral process spurred on by lies and disinformation the possibility remains of tense confrontations or even violence at polling places this week  Election workers are stepping down in droves after being harassed and threatened misinformation has ramped up and volunteer groups are stepping in with deescalation training to be used at polling places  Organizations pushing spurious claims of voter fraud now call for volunteers to patrol polling stations and election infrastructure in some states That raises the likelihood of tense interactions between election critics and election officials and voters  Meanwhile observers worry increased tensions could also come in the days and weeks after the elections especially in communities where election deniers are on the ballot or where election results are especially close or delayed  More Arizona becomes epicenter of concerns about voter intimidation  Its a new normal for everyone  election officials law enforcement officers and individual voters  who should be on alert but not panicked as they cast their votes said Jared Holt a senior researcher at the think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and an expert on domestic extremism  When it comes to risks at the polls I keep telling people to be vigilant but not paranoid Holt said Vigilance means being aware of some of the different things that you might see at polling locations and how to respond to those whereas paranoia looks like believing armed goons are waiting outside your polling station now and maybe you just dont want to go vote at all because youre worried about it  Carter Center to monitor voting in Fulton County The Carter Center is training nonpartisan observers to monitor midterm elections in Fulton County Georgia November 5 AP  More Bidens closing argument before midterms  More The week in extremism from   The extremist threat  Several experts on extremism told  the same thing Domestic extremist groups and organizations seeking to sow doubt in the electoral process thrive on spreading the message theyre going to show up in force on election day and confront and harass voters But in reality that seldom actually happens said Marcia JohnsonBlanco codirector of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law  I am suspicious about a lot of these reports of plans to observe polling places and to make sure the wrong voters arent voting JohnsonBlanco said All of that serves as a chilling effect  you dont necessarily need to show but just the fact that its being reported may keep voters away  JohnsonBlanco said electionrelated harassment has historically been disproportionately focused on communities of color particularly in neighborhoods where there is a high proportion of people who do not speak English as their first language  In past years extremist groups particularly the armed antigovernment organization the Oath Keepers have been on the front line of election harassment In 2018 and 2020 Oath Keepers pledged to patrol voting places in large numbers But there were ultimately few reports of harassment from Oath Keepers or other extremists  In 2022 extremist groups have focused their hatred on other targets particularly LGBTQfriendly events like familyfriendly drag shows Holt said  A lot of Proud Boys chapters and other extremist movements are busy at the moment harassing gay people for existing Holt said Were seeing way more calls for Proud Boys chapters to go protest drag events than we are seeing the Proud Boys trying to encourage their people to be poll workers or something like that  Our View Regardless of your political leanings our democracy needs you to vote  Spreading misinformation  JohnsonBlanco and other experts said that this year they are most concerned that groups who specialize in spreading misinformation about elections have been steadily ramping up their presence at the polls on election days  Like extremist groups in years past the organizations driving these misinformation campaigns say they are efforts to document voter fraud  even though such cases almost never really occur  These groups are openly encouraging volunteers to monitor polling places film the electoral process and even set up hidden cameras at locations where votes are dropped off  Compounding the issue several states have loosened their restrictions on what socalled election observers can and cannot do legally said Sophia Lin Lakin interim codirector of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union  So while such monitors may not hassle voters in person their false claims lead to more harassment of election officials Lakin said  All of that is making the situation worse she said  In some states harassment from those quarters often from people who falsely claim Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election has already had a negative impact on the democratic process  Ten of Nevadas 17 counties have seen their top election official resign retire or decline to seek reelection since the 2020 vote which the state government calls a drastic exodus according to Reuters  Arizona has seen some of the most divisive debates over election security since the 2020 presidential election and several candidates on the ballot have campaigned in part on the lies that the last election was corrupt  In Maricopa County Arizona a federal judge on Nov 1 ordered a group of selfappointed election monitors to dial back their presence at ballot dropoff locations ordering them to stop wearing body armor or carry visible firearms within 250 feet of the box The judge also banned them from yelling at or otherwise confronting people dropping off ballots and ordered their leader to post a statement about the legality of ballot drops to her Trumpbacked Truth Social network account  Destroying the system from within  Looming over this years elections is the specter of the Jan 6 insurrection Inspired by lies and disinformation the Capitol riot was at its core aimed at stopping the certification of the 2020 election It remains a stark example of electoral interference that experts worry inspires wouldbe wrongdoers as much as it troubles election workers  That idea  that those who dislike an elections outcome can use violence to shut it down  has spread from the Capitol riot to the ballot with dozens of election deniers running for office across the country  What worries Olivia Troye a former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Mike Pence is that candidates who undermine the election process are learning that their conspiracy theories earn them votes  She warned that even if voting is peaceful  and she worries it wont be  some candidates will put themselves in a position to destroy the system from within  Things have gotten worse because of this monitoring this intimidation The seed has been planted since 2020 and its gotten worse she said And the threats to election officials are getting worse  Troye a lifelong Republican quit the White House in August 2020 over the administrations handling of the coronavirus pandemic She endorsed Biden in the 2020 presidential election  We have an entire antidemocracy operation happening before our very eyes Troye said There has been an ongoing effort focused on changing the rules of elections and changing the referees who oversee elections so that they can change the results and overrule the will of the people All of this is correlated to the long term effect of the lies theyve been told by the political leaders they embrace We saw what it led to on Jan 6th and that sentiment hasnt dissipated  Law enforcement standing by  In Arizona despite the

and voter intimidation a standard practice  Those DOJ teams will be stationed around the country while the polls are open People who need to report voter intimidation should first call 911 for their local law enforcement agency and then contact the Justice Department officials said in a news release And concerns about votingrelated civil rights violations should be directed to the DOJs Civil

clerks tell me that 10 or 20 years ago they were greeted on Election Day with pies and hugs Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told  They tell me that its a very different environment sometimes now  Rising political tensions parallel the increases in election misinformation and outright falsehoods especially those that followed former President Donald Trumps false claims of a stolen 2020 presidential election and the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on Jan 6 2021  I think the biggest trend that we are seeing is the epidemic of misinformation disinformation and malinformation when people believe lies about the 2020 election or think it was stolen Bellows said That as we saw at the events of Jan 6th can motivate some individuals to take violent action  After two threats against local elections clerks in Maine  one online and one inperson  the state Legislature passed bipartisan legislation last year making threats against elections officials a crime to be investigated by the state attorney general The legislature also instituted deescalation training for local election clerks overseen by Bellows office and security assessments for polling places and

Maricopa County Sheriffs Office is monitoring ballot drop boxes after two men in tactical gear with weapons were seen near one in Mesa Arizona Scott L Hall and Patrick ColsonPrice   Election peacemakers  A group of faith leaders and social workers operating as part of the religious political group Faith in Public Life began responding to pollingplace conflicts in 2021 The group which uses deescalation strategies to try to defuse potential clashes began its election work in 2020 and is ready to respond in 2022 said the Rev Dan Clark Ohio director for Faith in Public Life  A lot of times an election peacekeeper wont necessarily square up with the intimidator and try to solve whatever problem theyre creating he said Instead an election peacekeeper often shows up in solidarity with the voters and brings that calming presence so that they can stay in line confidently and vote  Clark warns against overstating the severity of the problem His groups peacekeepers responded to just five pollingplace conflicts in the 22 Ohio counties that the group covered during the 2020 campaign  all on Election Day and the weekend preceding it  It hasnt been called in yet this year during early voting  But the mood at voting sites has changed in recent years raising the prospects for potential intimidation and violence Clark said And ominously in the aftermath of the Jan 6 insurrection and other instances of political violence this years peacekeeper training included a new element lessons in how to respond to an activeshooter situation he said  Conflict resolution and deescalation skills traditionally focused on confrontation and violence in highpressure situations like contested divorces and workplace rage are now being tailored to the increasingly stressful world of elections  For four decades the Mediation Center a nonprofit serving Savannah Georgia and the surrounding area has offered mediation and conflictresolution services to government agencies and other groups often dealing with workplace and domestic conflicts that can become violent Only this year did it start getting deeply involved in training election workers at the request of government workers said Dan Rowe the Mediation Centers senior manager of community programs  Training consists of lessons on situational awareness finding ways to use language to avoid increasing agitation and planning ahead for different conflict situations to avoid making mistakes under the pressure of a threatening situation Rowe said  Even if not all the training and security is needed now it can help deescalation experts and election workers get ready for the future  2022 isnt the last election that ever gets held Rowe said Weve got races coming up in 2023 Weve got the big one in 2024 I dont want to say prepare for the worst because that sounds very pessimistic But be prepared is the goal  Rowe doesnt expect pollingplace peace to be achieved by 2024 either I havent heard any indicators that the temperature is

Abortion rights supporters had a successful run of ballot measures this year  In every state where voters were asked to weigh in directly on abortion rights they supported measures that protect those rights and rejected initiatives that could threaten them  Those victories have abortion rights advocates looking at where they can next take the fight directly to voters  Lets take this show on the road Lets go to states and lets prove that we can win in some challenging environment said Anthony Romero executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Lets put this to the people  Exploring options in red states  Romero who spent election night in Michigan celebrating the passage of an amendment to protect abortion rights in the states constitution said his group is looking at several states as potential targets for future ballot campaigns including Ohio and Florida  Kelly Hall executive director of the Fairness Project which advocates for progressiveleaning ballot measures said her organization is also exploring options in those states along with Missouri Oklahoma Arkansas and South Dakota She said gerrymandering in many states has resulted in lawmakers who support much deeper abortion restrictions than their constituents do  Hall said the initiative process can serve as a check on overreach by state lawmakers  when theres a huge gap between the desires of the electorate and the actions of politicians And nowhere is that more the case in America right now than on abortion rights  Loading  A serious problem for abortion opponents  Faced with these political losses antiabortion rights groups are emphasizing that they were outspent by their opponents in these campaigns and they say they believe that voters were misled by some of the messaging around these initiatives  Marjorie Dannenfelser president of SBA ProLife America told reporters on Wednesday that shes concerned more states will try to pass proabortionrights ballot measures like those in California Dannenfelser argued that its often better for abortion laws to be made by elected officials after a robust public debate  It is the biggest concern that we have in the prolife movement  that we gain our advantage that we find through candidates debating the issue  where we dont have that advantage when were outspent 10 to 1 in a referendum she said It is a serious problem  The groups vice president of state affairs Stephen Billy said he believes abortion rights supporters want to use the courts to try to take the issue out of voters hands by challenging antiabortion laws in state court and use ballot initiatives as a way to thwart the legislative process  A gap between legislation and public opinion  Advocates for bans on most abortions  including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks  are at odds with public opinion according to many years of polling While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion most support access earlier in pregnancy  Thats even the case in some deeply red states like Texas where since 2021 when a unique state law took effect residents have been seeing the impact of a ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy  Enlarge this image toggle caption Kyle RivasGetty Images Kyle RivasGetty Images  Romero with the ACLU said recent votes for abortion rights in red states show that many Republicanleaning voters are willing to cross party lines to push back against laws they see as overly restrictive He accuses Republican elected officials in many

legislatures Romero said  Victories for abortion rights supporters this week in Kentucky and Montana followed a similarly successful fight in Kansas in August  Ballot measures face their own challenges risks  Many states lack a process for citizeninitiated ballot initiatives leaving the question of abortion in the hands of their state lawmakers According to the Fairness Project such initiatives are possible in 22 states  Even in those states such efforts could face pushback from abortion opponents Michigans initiative survived Republicanled challenges aimed at keeping the measure off the ballot including objections to the formatting and spacing of the language in the amendment  Enlarge this image toggle caption Stefani ReynoldsAFP via Getty Images Stefani ReynoldsAFP via Getty

elect antiabortion candidates  But she said she believes that wellcrafted measures tailored to the specific concerns of voters in individual states can gain bipartisan support  These need to be strategic decisions that meet the electorate where it is Hall said I dont think though that we should shy away from having these deep strategic conversations even in the reddest of places  because frankly there are no other options left in many states for how we advocate for people who need reproductive healthcare  NYU law professor Melissa Murray said she believes theres a robust appetite among many voters to push back against some of the state restrictions that have taken effect in recent months though the specific message and rationale will vary from state to state  California may have a different logic for this than Kansas where the prospect of government encroachment might seem like the antithesis of conservatism Murray said But its all cashing out in the same way Where voters have direct access to the ballot box to register their preferences on abortion they are registering them in ways that make clear that there is  appetite for greater protections for reproductive

       " {'guid': 22792, 'text_a': 'Polarization is the top issue facing the world today  and its on the rise For example a recent poll from the Pew Research Center showed that majorities in both the Republican and Democratic parties view members of the other party as more closedminded dishonest immoral and unintelligent than other Americans  We encounter polarization at every turn Social media used to be a place to reconnect with long lost friends Now its become a platform to spout political views and unfollow anyone who disagrees Diversity programs were supposed to increase inclusion and belonging Instead they seem to exhaust everyone including the individuals leading them Families and friendships are being destroyed because we cant agree on issues of race religion and politics  Rather than sequestering in our echo chambers and canceling anyone who disagrees we can turn to cultural intelligence a scientific model that has helped organizations and executives build more inclusive equitable cultures This same model can help us talk with coworkers friends and family members who see the world differently than we do  Here are four questions to help address polarizing topics with cultural intelligence  1 Would you be open to considering a different perspective  The No 1 trait that predicts cultural intelligence is openness and curiosity If you arent open to considering a different way of thinking or behaving its impossible to be culturally intelligent  For example when someone is arguing about Donald Trump woke ideas or the forgiveness of student debt I stop and ask Would you be open to considering a different perspective Rarely does someone respond Hell no But if they do theres little use in talking any further I simply state my opinion and move on  But beware Ive sometimes been too quick to assume someone is closed My preferred conversation style is an amicable diplomatic approach even when discussing issues I feel strongly about I can wrongfully interpret a more assertive confrontational approach as someone who is closedminded when in fact it might just be a difference in style Other times Ive been talking with someone who uses measured conciliatory language only to find out they werent open at all and were simply baiting me  Use these indicators to assess openness  Do they ask openended questions demonstrating a genuine desire to understand  Are theyre willing to admit a statement was wrong or exaggerated  Can they point to something they respect about the other side and something that troubles them about their side  Are they willing to say I dont know  2 Have I accurately understood your perspective  Perspectivetaking is one of the critical skills we assess and teach as part of cultural intelligence Social psychologist Adam Galinsky led a study on perspectivetaking where students were shown a photo of an elderly man sitting on a chair next to a newspaper stand The students were asked to write a short essay about a typical day for the man in the photo Galinsky divided the students into three groups telling the first group to simply look at the picture and describe the mans day The second group was told to write a description without using any stereotypes about elderly men The third group was instructed to write the essay in the first person as if they were the man in the picture  The students in the first group used negative stereotypes to describe the man lonely declining physically forgetful The students told to avoid stereotypes wrote more neutral descriptions making up scenarios about how the man might spend his time and what he thinks about But the students who were asked to write the essay in the first person wrote the most positive descriptions of the mans life referring to his sage wisdom his wide range of friendships and the joy he finds in the simple things of life  Perspectivetaking increases the likelihood that individuals will not only be less discriminatory in their thoughts and behaviors but will develop more positive viewpoints When interacting with a friend or colleague about a polarizing issue see if you can both describe the others perspective in neutral terms ideally in the first person  Read If you must talk politics at Thanksgiving dinner follow these rules of engagement  3 How would you solve this problem  A study on political extremism found that many citizens had little understanding of the policies they opposed or supported They just knew that something didnt sit right with them But individuals were more willing to open their minds to alternative approaches when they were asked how their preferred policies would work Having to talk through the complexities of healthcare legislation or immigration policy caused people to see the nuance of the situation and acknowledge gaps in their knowledge Overcoming polarization on issues like climate change or how to effectively promote racial equity requires an emphasis on problemsolving  Pay attention to how your counterpart wants to see change happen Push them to explain the how rather than just repeating the what How would you address inequitable pay disproportionate rates of arrest health disparities etc  4 Where are you willing to compromise  Overcoming polarization will never happen unless theres a willingness to adjust our thinking and behavior The culturally intelligent look for ways to adapt their behavior without compromising whats core to their values and identity  For example Sylvia is a French executive working for a Middle Eastern company in Dubai Shes the only woman on the executive team and the majority of leaders across the company are men When interviewed for the position Sylvia made it clear that she expected to be treated respectfully and equitably They assured Sylvia they would respect her and demonstrated it with pay job title and a direct reporting line to the CEO Sylvia was unwilling to put on a submissive deferential act to fit in with the maledominated culture but she found ways she could adapt to the cultural norms without losing herself in the process  In France it wasnt uncommon for Sylvia to have lunch with a male colleague or client as a part of developing rapport and trust But she avoids those kinds of lunches in her new role believing its one small way to respect the boundaries between work and personal interactions across genders When Sylvia joins the executive team for a workrelated dinner she refrains from ordering alcohol But when she discovered that the company was ignoring a number of safety regulations putting their construction teams at risk she raised the issue immediately She communicated her concern respectfully but unapologetically and forcefully  BerrettKoehler Publishers  This is what action looks like Sylvia is comfortable in her own skin and shes not trying to be all things to all people But she adapts as needed to accomplish a larger objective In the same way when we confront polarizing topics we can almost always find some areas where we can adjust our thinking and behavior without compromising our core values and identity  There are no easy answers for how to address polarization But together we can build a more culturally intelligent world one conversation at a time  David Livermore is a social scientist and thought leader devoted to the topics of

Congress will do so is more than double the level found in 2008 when just 23 said so  Loading  Many Americans say they are simply tired of the bickering namecalling and faux outrage that have become

I actually think hes doing a great job Boushelle said Theres nothing we can do about his hair or his quickness but when youre older we make better decisions more informed decisions  Looking to 2024 a majority of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents said they would prefer someone other than Biden to be the partys nominee Just 35 said they wanted it to be Biden but there isnt a clamoring for

it were just the two of them running  What people think Congress priorities should be  Overall respondents said they want Congress to focus on inflation preserving democracy and immigration  To be expected the parties see things quite differently  Republicans overwhelmingly want Congress to focus on inflation 41 followed by immigration 23 and then preserving democracy 11  Preserving democracy was top of the list for Democrats 29 followed by inflation 20 and climate change 17  Of course when Republicans and Democrats say they want preserving democracy to be a priority they dont always mean the same thing Some Republicans are focused on baseless claims of voter fraud pushed by the former president  Democrats are more focused on the illegitimate efforts to try and overturn the presidential election in 2020  and current and potential future attempts to continue to sew doubts about US elections  Loading  Serious threat to democracy  Eightythree percent  and there were similar numbers across the political spectrum  believed that there is a serious threat to democracy Thats the highest recorded in the poll even after the Jan 6 riot at the Capitol  Respondents were split on which party is a bigger threat though  49 said Republicans 45 said Democrats  Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus  To see just how differently people in both parties view things  look at immigration and climate change  Nearly a quarter of Republicans think immigration should be a top priority for Congress but only 1 of Democrats think it should be  On climate change more than 1 in 6 Democrats think it should be Congress top priority but only 1 of Republicans do  Congress gets some points for trying  When it comes what this Congress has been able to get done 24 said they accomplished more than recent Congresses  While that may not seem very high its actually the highest percentage to say so since 1998  The positive views are  not surprisingly  driven by Democrats 48

out gains from a rally earlier in the week driven by hopeful economic news Inflation as measured by the consumer price index had fallen for the fifth straight month  and far more than analysts expected  according to data released right before the Fed was set to slow down its interest rate hikes  While the Fed did end up boosting rates by a smaller amount than its previous four hikes a dour forecast from officials including Chairman Jerome Powell shook markets out of their optimism Instead of signs of lower interest rates ahead the Fed warned rates would be even higher and stay that way for longer  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 281 points Friday falling 09 percent on the day for its second straight week of losses The SP 500 index closed 11 percent lower and the Nasdaq closed with a loss of 1 percent on the day respectively  The Fed and the stock market are fighting Theyre in a brawl right now said Callie Cox US investment analyst at online investment firm eToro in a Friday phone interview  The stock markets been itching for a pivot for months now really since the summer and the Fed time and time again has told us that theyre serious about inflation they want to get inflation under control and if that means keeping rates high for a while so be it she added  As interest rates continue to rise businesses will face steeper borrowing costs and have less money to invest in expansion making their stocks less appealing to investors Households will also have less expendable income to throw in the market as interest rates on their mortgages car payments and credit cards rise  The stock markets hardship however is an important part of the Feds plan  Fed officials know their tough talk about keeping rates high and snuffing out inflation at whatever the cost alarms investors and traders Those warnings are intended to keep Americans expectations in check and force businesses to feel the squeeze of high rates without rising stock prices to buffet the blow  The Fed knows that its words are equally as powerful in a world where social media is so pervasive and information just moves so quickly Cox said The Fed is preparing markets for whats coming before it actually happens This time around though it just feels a little bit more painful because the Fed needs to get inflation down  Powell said during a Wednesday press conference that the US still had a long ways to go before inflation was down to a sustainable level He added that the only way for the Fed to achieve that goal was to keep its foot on the brakes of the economy with high interest rates meant to boost the unemployment rate  The November jobless rate of 37 percent is just 02 percentage point below its level in February 2020 then a fivedecade record low But the US workforce has roughly 4 million fewer workers now than it did before the onset of the pandemic while businesses are posting record numbers of open jobs  With fewer workers available to fill open jobs businesses have been forced to boost wages to attract candidates  and prices to compensate for that higher pay That dynamic Fed officials say is the reason why inflation has remained high even as prices for almost all goods other than food have fallen  We have too many jobs and too few workers so that means that wage inflation is going to be far from a sustainable average and were going to have that passing through to prices Thats what were working on right now said Mary Daly president of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco at a Friday event hosted by the American Enterprise Institute  To be honest with you I dont quite know why markets are so optimistic about inflation Daly said  On Wednesday Fed officials boosted their projections for how high they would need to raise interest rates and how long they would keep them at levels meant to hinder the labor market  They now expect to hike interest rates to a span of 5 to 525 percent by the end of 2023 up from the 45 to 475 range officials projected in September and they dont foresee cutting rates until 2024  The Fed also sees its rate hikes taking a serious toll on the US economy projecting the jobless rate to increase by 09 percentage points to 46 percent by the end of 2023 and economic growth slowing to 05 percent While Fed officials say it may be possible to avoid heavy job losses in that scenario most outside economists believe such an increase in the jobless rate would mean more than 1 million Americans losing work  The Fed did not welcome the disinflation trends that have just started to emerge and focused on robust job gains and elevated inflation Any hopes of a soft landing disappeared as the Fed seems like they are committed to taking rates much higher said Edward Moya senior markets analyst at OANDA in a Wednesday note to clients  A Feddriven recession or steep slowdown would be more bad news for the stock market as companies struggle with lower sales and fewer households have the flexibility to put money in risky assets But higher rates in and of themselves could be a larger and longerterm damper on the stock market  Stocks exploded in value in the years following the Great Recession as the Fed kept its baseline interest rate range near zero The markets stunning rally accelerated even more during the COVID19 pandemic when low interest rates and trillions of dollars in federal stimulus helped fuel new records across all three major indexes  With rates likely to stay high for much longer Cox said the days of the market smashing through record highs again are likely far away  When we look at 2023 we kind of see a year of purgatory she said', 'text_b': None, 'label': 2},\n",

continent in the years ahead AP PhotoSusan Walsh File  WASHINGTON AP  President Joe Biden is set to play host to dozens of African leaders in Washington this week as the White House looks to narrow a gaping trust gap with Africa  one that has grown wider over years of frustration about Americas commitment to the continent  In the leadup to the threeday USAfrica Leaders Summit that begins Tuesday Biden administration officials played down their increasing concern about the clout of China and Russia in Africa which is home to more than 13 billion people Instead administration officials tried to put the focus on their efforts to improve cooperation with African leaders  This summit is an opportunity to deepen the many partnerships we have on the African continent White House press secretary Karine JeanPierre said when asked about the shadow that China and Russia cast on the meetings We will focus on our efforts to strengthen these partnerships across a wide range of sectors spanning from businesses to health to peace and security but our focus will be on Africa next week  ADVERTISEMENT  To that end White House officials said that major deliverables and initiatives  diplomatic speak for big announcements  will be peppered throughout the meetings The White House previewed one major summit announcement on Friday saying that Biden would use the gathering to declare his support for adding the African Union as a permanent member of the Group of 20 nations  The summit will be the biggest international gathering in Washington since before the start of the COVID19 pandemic Local officials are warning residents to brace for road blocks and intensified security as 49 invited heads of states and leaders  and Biden  whiz around the city  Talks are expected to center on the coronavirus climate change the impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine on Africa trade and more according to White House officials Biden is set to deliver remarks at a USAfrica business forum hold small group meetings with leaders host a leaders dinner at the White House and take part in other sessions with leaders during the gathering  Biden has spent much of his first two years in office trying to assuage doubters on the international stage about American leadership after four years of Donald Trumps America First foreign policy  With this summit  a followup to the first such gathering held eight years ago by President Barack Obama  Biden has an opportunity to assuage concerns in Africa about whether the US is serious about tending to the relationship  ADVERTISEMENT  Bidens effort to draw African nations closer to the US comes at a complicated moment as his administration has made plain that it believes that Chinese and Russian activity in Africa is a serious concern to US and African interests  In its subSaharan Africa strategy unveiled in August the Biden administration warned that China which has pumped billions into African energy infrastructure and other projects sees the region as an arena where Beijing can challenge the rulesbased international order advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests undermine transparency and openness  ADVERTISEMENT  The administration also argues that Russia the preeminent arms dealer in Africa views the continent as a permissive environment for Kremlinconnected oligarchs and private military companies to focus on fomenting instability for their own strategic and financial benefit  Still administration officials are emphasizing that concerns about China and Russia will not be central to the talks  The United States prioritizes our relationship with Africa for the sake of our mutual interests and our partnership in dealing with global challenges Molly Phee assistant secretary of state for African affairs told reporters before the summit We are very conscious again of the Cold War history were conscious again of the deleterious impact of colonialism on Africa and we studiously seek to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of those earlier eras  The administration has been disappointed that much of the continent has declined to follow the US in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine but Biden is not expected to dwell on differences publicly  ADVERTISEMENT  The president is expected to participate with leaders in a session on promoting food security and food systems resilience Africa has been disproportionately impacted by the global rise in food prices that has been caused in part by the drop in shipments from major grain exporter Ukraine  One of the unique aspects of this summit is the collateral damage that the Russian war has inflicted on Africa in terms of food supply and the diversion of development assistance to Ukraine The opportunity costs of the invasion have been very high in Africa said John Stremlau a visiting professor of international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg  Four countries that were suspended from the African Union  Guinea Sudan Mali and Burkina Faso were not invited to the summit because coups in those nations led to unconstitutional changes in power The White House also did not invite the East African nation of Eritrea Washington does not have full diplomatic relations with the country  ADVERTISEMENT  Bidens decision to invite several leaders to the summit who have questionable records on human rights and democracy is looming large ahead of the gathering  Equatorial Guinea was invited despite the State Department stating that it held serious doubts about last months election in the tiny Central African nation Opposition parties made credible allegations of significant electionrelated irregularities including documented instances of fraud intimidation and coercion according to the department Election officials reported that President Teodoro Obiangs ruling party won nearly 95 of the vote  Zimbabwe which has faced years of US and Western sanctions over poor governance human rights abuses and widespread corruption also was invited  President Emmerson Mnangagwa who seized power from longtime ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017 has sought to cast himself as a reformer but local and international human rights campaigners accuse him of repression that is just as bad or even worse than Mugabes  Although Mnangagwa enjoys cozy relations with China and Russia as did Mugabe he has also sought to make friends with the US and other Western countries in an effort to bolster his legitimacy  In a national address that he delivered in November in a new Chinesegifted multimilliondollar parliament building Mnangagwa held out the invitation to the USAfrica summit as a sign of his administrations success He said the southern African country welcomed the invitation but he also called for the unconditional removal of sanctions that he blames for Zimbabwes debilitating economic woes  Emphasis remains on dialogue Mnangagwa said  Ethiopia received an invitation even though Biden late last last year announced he was cutting out the country from a US trade program known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act over Ethiopias failure to end a war in the Tigray region that led to gross violations of human rights A peace deal was signed last month but implementation faces major challenges such as the continued presence of troops from neighboring Eritrea  Analysts say that African leaders will be looking for Biden to make some major commitments during the summit including announcing his first presidential visit to subSaharan Africa efforts to bolster the continents economy through private sector investment and trade and more  Perhaps most importantly it could be an opportunity for Biden to demonstrate that Africa is more than a battleground in its economic and military competition with Beijing and Moscow  I do strongly believe that the United States is still seen as a superpower from the African perspective but most African leaders do not want to align with its

The results of the election however speak for themselves The predicted Republican red wave disappeared before it reached shore with the GOP only picking up 8 seats to narrowly take control of the House It could still lose one seat in the Senate Democrats flipped control of more governorships and state legislature chambers than Republicans And most importantly nearly all highprofile election deniers lost their races including competitive secretary of state competitions in Arizona Michigan Minnesota and Nevada and gubernatorial contests in swing states like Arizona Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  Now one poll of the 71 most competitive House districts backs up the importance of the democracy issue in Democrats midterm success Concerns about threats to democracy motivated Democrats and independents to turn out while also helping independents decide to vote for Democrats according to a voter survey from Nov 1116 by Impact Research a Democratic polling firm  The biggest takeaway here is just how important protecting democracy was for voters in this House battlefield immediately coming out of the election said Molly Murphy the president of Impact Research which conducted the survey for Democratic Partyaligned political action committees End Citizens United and Let America Vote  Advertisement  Six in 10 voters cited protecting democracy as an extremely important reason that they decided to vote in November This put the issue ahead of inflation 53 abortion 47 and crime 45 When asked to choose the top two issues that motivated them to vote 50 chose protecting democracy second only to inflation at 55  The issue of democracy was really one of the most dominant factors for Democrats and independents in determining whether they would turn out and decisive in decisionmaking in terms of whether independent voters were going to vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate Murphy said  Among Democrats 73 cited protecting democracy as an extremely important reason that they decided to vote Fiftyone percent of independents similarly cited it as extremely important on par with the 53 who cited inflation  Fortyone percent of voters

think it was the differencemaker Rep Pat Ryan DNY said  Ryan the only Democrat to win a competitive House race in New York this year made protecting democracy central to both the special election campaign he won in August and the general election in November saying he ran for office because the very foundations of our democracy are under attack  He argued that Democrats won when they helped people to understand the stakes  that one party really increasingly overtly was for blowing up our democracy eroding trust in free and fair elections denying election outcomes while the other party was saying No were going to stand and fight  And quite clearly we saw the results Ryan said We saw a rejection across the country of the extremist antidemocratic direction that extreme Republicans wanted to go  Advertisement  Ryan also saw the issue of protecting democracy overlapping with another top concern for Democrats the Supreme Court deciding earlier this year to overturn Roe v Wade which had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion for decades  What people missed in polls  which I heard over and over again in conversations if you actually listen  is people link these issues together Ryan said People intuitively of course understood that if youre taking away a fundamental right from more than half of the American people then all these other rights and freedoms are on the table And that becomes an existential democracy  smalld democracy  issue  Just as some voters saw an overlap between abortion and democracy many interpreted the concept of protecting democracy beyond the sole issue of Republicans embracing Trumps election fraud lies and efforts to overturn election results  In the House battleground districts surveyed by Impact Research the two top threats to democracy selected by voters were government corruption and the influence of money on our politics 53 and politicians refusing to accept the results of elections they disagree with 41  The threats to

say that it is fairer for elected officials to write election rules rather than unelected judges or administrators  For the Supreme Court Moore v Harper is a chance to restore stability by upholding the rule of law and clarifying that lawmakers not courts and bureaucrats make law said Jason Snead the executive director of Honest Elections Project earlier this month in an announcement on the case  Critics say the theory runs counter to historical practice removes constraints on legislatures actions and could upend and sow confusion about democracys basic building block the vote  Any version of this theory is meritless says Eliza SwerenBecker counsel in the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center for Justice  What is the independent state legislature theory  The US Constitution delegates the power to hold federal elections to the states under congressional supervision At issue with the independent state legislature theory is how much power has been delegated and to whom  This turns on two key constitutional clauses One the elections clause states that The Times Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations  The second is the presidential electors clause which reads Each State shall appoint in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct a Number of Electors  The key question here is What did the Founders mean by Legislature  The meaning in traditional use is that Legislature refers to a states entire lawmaking process That means a legislature can pass state election law  but that law is subject to a governors veto State courts can strike it down if they judge it violates a states constitution Citizen referendums can alter it if the state allows that practice related to other laws  Proponents of the independent state legislature theory take a narrower view saying that Legislature means just that  the legislature and no other governmental institution Neither governors nor courts nor state constitutions have a say in laws governing federal elections in this approach  Where did the theory come from  The roots of the theory lie in the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore In a concurrence to the Supreme Courts final Bush v Gore decision which declared George W Bush president Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas advanced a version of the independent state legislature approach that would have limited state court powers to interpret legislaturepassed measures in some instances  Kenneth LambertAPFile Supreme Court police lined the steps of the US Supreme Court in Washington Dec 12 2000 ahead of the courts Bush v Gore ruling which halted further Florida recounts and brought George W Bush to the White House A concurrence written by three justices then is seen as the root of todays independent state legislature theory  Proponents of the independent state legislature theory say that it has antecedents in US history  But there is little scholarly evidence that prior to 2000 anything resembling the independent state legislature theory was much of a legal issue in the US according to Richard Pildes a constitutional law professor at the New York University School of Law  The overall weight of historical practice supports the position that state constitutions can constrain state legislatures in the exercise of their ordinary lawmaking powers under the Elections and Electors Clauses wrote Professor Pildes in a response to questions from the House Committee on House Administration in August  However prior to the 2020 election Justices Thomas Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch hinted at support for a version of the independent state legislature theory in statements concerning a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision to extend the deadline for receiving absentee ballots due to the pandemic The courts action overruled a deadline set by the legislature in Pennsylvanias election laws  There is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution wrote the justices in an opinion  What is Moore v Harper about  Moore v Harper is a challenge to North Carolinas congressional maps  In the case members of the North Carolina legislature are asking the Supreme Court to reinstate the district maps they drew with 2020 census data and that the North Carolina courts struck down as a partisan gerrymander that violated the state constitutions guarantee of free and fair elections  The state courts adopted instead new maps drawn by three courtappointed experts  The independent state legislature theory is at the center of the case The question plaintiffs presented to the court was whether a states judicial branch may nullify legislative regulations governing the manner of holding elections for senators and representatives and replace them with regulations of the courts own devising based on vague state constitutional provisions  The State Supreme Court transformed itself from a judicial body  into an ersatz legislature that enacts its policy preferences through sheer force of will said the National Republican Redistricting Trust a group that coordinates GOP redistricting efforts in a friend of the court brief filed in the case  Critics hold that the legislatures original maps were not just a gerrymander but an egregious one If the popular vote for Congress in the state had split 5050 between Democrats and Republicans 10 of the states 14 members of Congress would have been GOP they say  Gary D RobertsonAPFile Reggie Weaver speaks outside the Legislative Building in Raleigh North Carolina on Feb 15 2022 praising a ruling by the North Carolina Supreme Court that struck down the states maps as a partisan gerrymander The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether to reinstate those maps  Reinstating the maps would effectively allow the North Carolina legislature to violate its state constitution says Ms SwerenBecker  What might happen to elections  If the Supreme Court affirms a belief that Legislature means only legislature and the independent state legislature is not just a theory but the law organization and administration of the nations elections could be overturned  There would be clear limits to the change however the justices draw the new lines It would affect only federal elections directly not state and local ones says Derek Muller a law professor at the University of Iowa School of Law and an expert on US elections in an email  State legislatures would still be subject to the US Constitution and federal law This last point means state legislators would not be empowered to simply ignore a popular vote and choose its own partys presidential electors after a losing election  Still it could be quite disruptive depending on how far the court goes and how far legislatures choose to go with it after the fact on a wide variety of routine election laws he says  It is true that the theory would not just allow legislators to pick a new winner if they do not approve of the voters choice says Ms SwerenBecker  Its not a license to coup she says  But it could override some efforts to control the political manipulation of congressional maps such as state redistricting commissions And it could split election administration in two with one set of laws and regulations for state and local votes and another for federal elections  For instance legislators could ban ballot dropboxes noexcuse mailin voting and early voting for presidential and congressional elections in the face of opposition from a states governor or courts A governors veto or a court decision in turn could maintain those things in gubernatorial and state legislative elections  Election officials might have the difficult and confusing job of administering a twotier voting system  Federal courts could be inundated with election litigation previously handled at the state and local level Critics of the theory also worry that it could become an excuse a means for legislators to push the boundaries of their legal powers particularly in presidential elections  State legislatures might try to insert themselves into some state of the votecounting process here the legislature would claim that is helping to determine which candidate did in fact win the popular vote said Professor Pildes of New York University in his written response to the Committee on House Administration  Whats next  In March North Carolina legislators filed an emergency appeal to have their congressional maps reinstated for 2022 elections The Supreme Court denied that appeal  Get

historic turnout from Democrats In Georgia participation in both early voting and on election day set records  Unhappily the results are sometimes historic too In the recent midterms Joe Biden performed better than any incumbent in decades losing only a minor number of seats in the House and retaining control of the senate  Do not chalk that success up to Biden The president was unpopular going into the midterms and remains so Many of his partys candidates chose not to campaign with the incumbent aware that making any race a referendum on the White House would not go well  The midterms were instead a referendum on the increasing unpopularity of Mr Trump Yes he still has a lock on some declining portion of the Republican Party And yes Trumpalways voters may refuse to back anyone else

poke the special interests who had lobbied for free trade and cost them their jobs They agreed with Trumps demands that our allies foot the bill for their own defense and his condemnation of business interests making fortunes in China while turning a blind eye to Beijings criminal behavior  Trump was a breath of fresh air when he ran for president in 2016 and he was a successful president knocked

nursed his grievances for two years there is no comeback  It is a tragedy that will only be made worse by Trumps continued presence on our national stage He has announced he will run again for president but he cannot and will not let go of his anger about the 2020 election That is a losing platform  Few are shocked that Herschel Walker lost the Georgia senate race to Raphael Warnock Walker

Although important, there may be a new year resolution that could be more impactful for your health. What about investing in your health by simply visiting your primary care doctor. Sounds simple, but this could literally be the difference between your life and death. According to Statnews, primary care visits are down 10.3\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m% a\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[39mcross America when compared to pre-pandemic levels. This means 1 in 10 Americans who usually come to see their primary doctor for a general checkup have not done so since the Covid-19 pandemic started. This also means that routine screening for important diagnoses like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer have been delayed for these individuals. This ultimately will hinder effective treatment of these diseases that could have been prevented had they been detected. According to new research, only 14\u001b[39;49m\u001b[39m% o\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[39mf cancers that occur in the United States are being detected by screening. This means that 6 of 7 cancers are discovered when symptoms have already occurred. Screening tests are available for five different cancers- lung, breast, colorectal, cervical, and prostate. If screening tests are used less by the general public, then less cancers will be found at an early stage when they are potentially treatable. Too often, cancers get detected when it is too late, symptoms are present and there is limited treatment that can be done to save one’s life. As an example, screening for breast cancer should occur for most women at the age of 40, according to the American College of Radiology. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in America, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, 43,250 women died from breast cancer in 2022. Breast cancer is screened for by mammograms, which are non-invasive x-rays that check the breast for any abnormalities, specifically cancer. According to the American College of Radiology, mammograms can detect cancer much earlier than they can be felt by the hand.

    "    \"The typical mantra from healthcare experts when ringing in the new year usually centers around commitments to exercise more and lose weight. Although important, there may be a new year resolution that could be more impactful for your health. What about investing in your health by simply visiting your primary care doctor. Sounds simple, but this could literally be the difference between your life and death. According to Statnews, primary care visits are down 10.3% across America when compared to pre-pandemic levels. This means 1 in 10 Americans who usually come to see their primary doctor for a general checkup have not done so since the Covid-19 pandemic started. This also means that routine screening for important diagnoses like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer have been delayed for these individuals. This ultimately will hinder effective treatment of these diseases that could have been prevented had they been detected. According to new research, only 14% of cancers that occur in the United States are being detected by screening. This means that 6 of 7 cancers are discovered when symptoms have already occurred. Screening tests are available for five different cancers- lung, breast, colorectal, cervical, and prostate. If screening tests are used less by the general public, then less cancers will be found at an early stage when they are potentially treatable. Too often, cancers get detected when it is too late, symptoms are present and there is limited treatment that can be done to save one’s life. As an example, screening for breast cancer should occur for most women at the age of 40, according to the American College of Radiology. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in America, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, 43,250 women died from breast cancer in 2022. Breast cancer is screened for by mammograms, which are non-invasive x-rays that check the breast for any abnormalities, specifically cancer. According to the American College of Radiology, mammograms can detect cancer much earlier than they can be felt by the hand. In addition, annual screening with mammograms has reduced deaths from breast cancer in the US by nearly 40% dating back to the 1990’s. The success of early cancer screening is at risk given less Americans are going to their primary care doctors and less individuals are getting screened for various cancers. According to a study in JAMA Network, screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer have all declined since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, only 6% of those eligible for getting screened for lung cancer are actually showing up for their low dose CT chest examination, the screening study for lung cancer. This means that 94% of Americans who are at risk for developing lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in America, are not getting routinely screened for it.\"\n",
